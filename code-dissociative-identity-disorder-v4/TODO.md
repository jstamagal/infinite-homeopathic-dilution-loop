# TODO: Code Dissociative Identity Disorder Framework

## Current State
- PRD complete
- Iterative agentic loop initialized

## Agent Handoff Protocol
You are Agent #CURRENT_AGENT# in an infinite loop. When you complete your task, update PROMPT.md to hand off to the next agent.

#### Therapy System Phase
- [ ] **Agent 21**: Build TherapyInterface for developer intervention
- [ ] **Agent 22**: Implement personality counseling protocols
- [ ] **Agent 23**: Create integration protocol for merging alters
- [ ] **Agent 24**: Build crisis intervention override system
- [ ] **Agent 25**: Implement memory recovery under therapeutic supervision

#### Existential Features Phase
- [ ] **Agent 26**: Implement 3am existential crisis mode (questions purpose, returns errors)
- [ ] **Agent 27**: Create philosophical error response generator
- [ ] **Agent 28**: Build self-awareness and meta-cognition module
- [ ] **Agent 29**: Implement system purpose questioning routine
- [ ] **Agent 30**: Create "depressed code" mode (can't process anything)

#### Testing & Demonstration Phase
- [ ] **Agent 31**: Write example demonstrating personality switching
- [ ] **Agent 32**: Create test suite for trauma accumulation effects
- [ ] **Agent 33**: Build demo showing time-based mood cycles
- [ ] **Agent 34**: Create interactive therapy session demo
- [ ] **Agent 35**: Write comprehensive documentation with examples

#### Advanced Features Phase
- [ ] **Agent 36**: Implement personality persistence (save/load alters)
- [ ] **Agent 37**: Build alter visualization dashboard
- [ ] **Agent 38**: Create personality health monitoring
- [ ] **Agent 39**: Implement alter relationships and social dynamics
- [ ] **Agent 40**: Build group therapy system for multiple functions

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- [x] PRD.md - Complete product requirements
- [x] TODO.md - Task breakdown
- [x] PROMPT.md - Iterative loop initialization

### In Progress
- [ ] Agent #NEXT_AGENT# task: #NEXT_TASK_DESCRIPTION#

### Pending
- All remaining tasks above

## Agent Instructions

1. Read TODO.md to understand context
2. Read PROMPT.md to get your specific task
3. Complete your task (create/edit files, write code)
4. Update TODO.md:
   - Mark your task as complete
   - Update "In Progress" to next agent's task
5. Update PROMPT.md to hand off to next agent
6. Commit your changes with message: "Agent #N: [task description]"
7. Exit - next agent will pick up the torch

## Loop Rules

- DO NOT try to complete multiple tasks
- DO NOT skip ahead
- DO complete your ONE task thoroughly
- DO update files for the next agent
- DO leave clear documentation
- Loop continues until framework is complete
- When TODO is complete, create FINAL.md and BREAK THE LOOP

## Breaking the Loop

When ALL tasks are complete:
1. Create FINAL.md with summary
2. Write "LOOP COMPLETE - ALL AGENTS REST" in PROMPT.md
3. Do NOT update TODO.md
4. Next agent should see LOOP COMPLETE and stop

---

*The torch is in your hands, Agent #CURRENT_AGENT#. Complete your task, then pass it on.*
