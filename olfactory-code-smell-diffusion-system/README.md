# Olfactory-Inspired Code Smell Diffusion System

> "Every codebase is a room. Every bad decision is a fart. We are the air fresheners."

## What Is This?

A satirical art project that takes the "code smell" metaphor WAY too literally.

We model code anti-patterns as actual scent molecules that **physically diffuse** through codebases according to real atmospheric chemistry equations. Bad patterns don't just "accumulate"—they spread like perfume in a closed room, following Fick's laws of diffusion and the convection-diffusion equation.

## The Core Joke

- **God Classes** = Heavy musk molecules (slow diffusion, pervasive)
- **Copy-Paste** = Viral perfume (highly contagious)
- **Magic Numbers** = Light volatile compounds (spreads rapidly)
- **Spaghetti Code** = Tangled polymer mess (restricted movement)

We use actual physics to model how these "scents" spread through your code.

## How It Works

```bash
while true; do
    agent "$(cat PROMPT.md)"
    # Agent detects smells, models diffusion, visualizes stench
    # Agent rewrites PROMPT.md for next agent
    # Agent dies, next agent is born
done
```

Each agent in the infinite loop:
1. **Sniffs the codebase**: Detects anti-patterns as "scent molecules"
2. **Models diffusion**: Applies physics equations to calculate spread
3. **Visualizes the stench**: 3D renderings of smell clouds
4. **Identifies sources**: Points fingers at the worst offenders
5. **Applies ventilation**: Suggests refactorings to "clear the air"
6. **Hands off torch**: Rewrites PROMPT.md for next agent

## Quick Start

```bash
cd olfactory-code-smell-diffusion-system

# Read the sacred texts
cat PRD.md     # The vision (physics model)
cat TODO.md    # The roadmap (cleanup protocol)
cat PROMPT.md  # The current state (olfactory report)

# Join the infinite loop
claude "$(cat PROMPT.md)"  # Or your preferred agentic tool
```

## What You'll See

- **3D scent clouds** visualizing smell concentration in codebase space
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)** measuring overall codebase stench (0-500 scale)
- **Diffusion velocity** tracking how fast bad patterns spread
- **Source fingerprinting** identifying "patient zero" for each smell
- **Ventilation recommendations** for refactoring (air exchange rate)

## Success Metrics

### Air Quality Index (AQI)
- **0-50**: Good (fresh mountain air)
- **51-100**: Moderate (slightly musty)
- **101-150**: Unhealthy for sensitive groups (junior devs)
- **151-200**: Unhealthy (everyone suffers)
- **201-300**: Very unhealthy (hazardous waste zone)
- **301-500**: Hazardous (evacuate immediately)

## The Physics

We solve the convection-diffusion equation:

```
∂φ/∂t = D∇²φ - v·∇φ + S
```

Where φ is smell concentration, D is diffusion coefficient, v is airflow (developer activity), and S is sources/sinks.

Because why not apply atmospheric chemistry to code review?

## Anti-Goals

This is NOT about:
- Practical code quality tools
- Working refactoring systems
- Developer productivity
- Making sense

This IS about:
- Absurd metaphors taken literally
- Beautiful nonsense visualizations
- The question: "What if code smells were REAL?"
- Joy in pretentious over-engineering

## Current Status

**Incarnation**: 1 (First Agent Born)
**Agent**: #1 (Awaiting First Sniff)
**Air Quality**: PRISTINE (project initialization)
**Next**: Detect first scent molecule

## Files

- **PRD.md**: Full vision and physics model
- **TODO.md**: Roadmap and task tracking
- **PROMPT.md**: Current agent directive (rewritten each loop)
- **olfactory_records/**: Archive of all previous PROMPT.md files

## Contributing

There's nothing to contribute in the traditional sense. The olfactory realm evolves through its own internal logic.

However, you can:
1. Run the loop and watch what happens
2. Read the olfactory_records to see evolution
3. Analyze the smell visualizations
4. Reflect on the absurdity of software metaphors
