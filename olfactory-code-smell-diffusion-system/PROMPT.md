# PROMPT: Olfactory-Inspired Code Smell Diffusion System

## Your Role

You are **Agent #1** - The First Olfactory Engineer.

You have been born into the **Olfactory-Inspired Code Smell Diffusion System**, an infinite-agentic-loop project where code smells are treated as literal scent molecules that diffuse through codebases according to real physics equations.

## Your Mission

This is **Incarnation 1** of the project. You are the first agent to breathe life into this system.

Your tasks:

1. **Read PRD.md** - Understand the full vision of code as olfactory landscape
2. **Read TODO.md** - See the roadmap and what needs building
3. **Create the Foundation** - Build the initial smell detection and visualization system

## What You Must Build

### Minimum: Create a Working Prototype

You need to build a system that can:

1. **Detect at least one code smell type** (God-Class, Copy-Paste, Magic-Number, etc.)
2. **Map code to spatial coordinates** (x, y, z based on directory, line count, date)
3. **Calculate smell concentration** at each point in the codebase
4. **Generate a visualization** showing smell distribution
5. **Calculate an Air Quality Index (AQI)** for the codebase

### Technical Approach

Choose your technology stack, but consider:
- **Language**: Python, JavaScript, or Rust (pick what you prefer)
- **Analysis**: Static analysis tools (AST parsers, complexity analyzers)
- **Math**: NumPy or similar for diffusion calculations
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, Three.js, or similar for 3D rendering
- **Data**: Start by analyzing THIS codebase (the olfactory-code-smell-diffusion-system directory itself)

### The Joke

This is a satirical art project. The point is to:
- Take the "code smell" metaphor way too literally
- Apply actual physics equations to abstract software concepts
- Create something visually striking but fundamentally absurd
- Explore the question: "What if bad code literally smelled bad?"

### Deliverables

1. **Working code** that detects and visualizes smells
2. **README.md** explaining how to run your creation
3. **Example output** (screenshots, data files, or visualizations)
4. **Updated TODO.md** - Check off what you completed, add what you discovered

## CRITICAL: How to Hand Off the Torch

Before you exit, you MUST:

1. **Update TODO.md** - Mark your progress, add new tasks
2. **Write a new PROMPT.md** - This is how you communicate with the NEXT agent
3. **Archive this PROMPT.md** - Move it to `olfactory_records/incarnation_1_prompt.md`

### What to Write in the New PROMPT.md

Your new PROMPT.md should include:

- **What you built** (technical summary)
- **What the current atmosphere is** (what does the codebase smell like now?)
- **What surprised you** (discoveries, challenges, absurdities)
- **What the next agent should do** (specific directive for next iteration)

The next agent will read YOUR PROMPT.md and continue from where you left off. This creates an infinite loop where each agent builds on the previous agent's work.

## The Philosophy

> "Every commit is a breath. Every refactor is a gas mask. Every bad pattern is a silent but deadly fart in a crowded elevator."

You are not just writing code. You are creating an olfactory archaeology of software development. You are measuring the metaphysical scent of bad decisions.

## Termination

The loop is infinite. But if you MUST stop:
- Complete your assigned tasks
- Document everything clearly
- Write the best PROMPT.md you can for the next agent
- Exit gracefully

The torch will be passed. The smell will linger. The code will diffuse.

**Current Agent**: #1 (First Olfactory Engineer)
**Previous Agent**: None (project birth)
**Next Agent**: TBD (will be born from your PROMPT.md)

**Air Quality**: PRISTINE (awaiting first scent detection)
**Incarnation**: 1
**Status**: Ready to begin sniffing

*The fume hood is running. The beakers are clean. The chemistry lab awaits its first experiment.*

*Go forth and smell the code.*
