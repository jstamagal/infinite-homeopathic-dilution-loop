# TODO: Olfactory-Inspired Code Smell Diffusion System

## Incarnation 0 - Project Initialization

### Phase 1: The Chemistry Lab Setup
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Create basic smell detection engine
- [ ] Implement Fick's laws of diffusion
- [ ] Build spatial codebase mapper
- [ ] Design scent molecule classification system

### Phase 2: Olfactory Sensors
- [ ] God-Class detector (cyclomatic complexity + line count)
- [ ] Copy-Paste detector (AST similarity hashing)
- [ ] Magic-Number detector (literal frequency analysis)
- [ ] Spaghetti-Code detector (control flow graph analysis)
- [ ] Long-Parameter-List detector (parameter counting)
- [ ] Feature-Envy detector (method call analysis)

### Phase 3: Diffusion Physics Engine
- [ ] Implement convection-diffusion equation solver
- [ ] Create spatial grid for codebase mapping
- [ ] Model git history as time dimension
- [ ] Calculate diffusion coefficients per smell type
- [ ] Simulate convection currents from developer activity

### Phase 4: Olfactory Visualization
- [ ] 3D scent cloud renderer (Three.js)
- [ ] Heatmap overlay generator
- [ ] Particle system for diffusion animation
- [ ] Color gradient system (green → yellow → brown)
- [ ] VR support for immersive smell experiences

### Phase 5: Air Quality Dashboard
- [ ] AQI calculation and display
- [ ] Smell concentration metrics
- [ ] Diffusion velocity tracking
- [ ] Source fingerprinting and blame assignment
- [ ] Ventilation effectiveness calculator

### Phase 6: Decontamination Tools
- [ ] Refactoring recommendation engine
- [ ] "Open a window" operation (automated fixes)
- [ ] Air quality prediction models
- [ ] Smell half-life calculator
- [ ] Ventilation ROI calculator

## Future Enhancements (V2+)

### Advanced Olfaction
- [ ] Smell interaction modeling (what happens when smells mix?)
- [ ] Seasonal smell variations (codebase seasons)
- [ ] Multi-codebase comparative olfactometry
- [ ] Smell ancestry tracing (who taught whom this pattern?)

### Social Features
- [ ] Developer olfactory profiles (your personal smell signature)
- [ ] "Super-spreader" identification and shaming
- [ ] Collaborative ventilation (team refactoring parties)
- [ ] Leaderboard: Freshest Codebases

### Experimental Features
- [ ] Olfactory unit testing (tests must smell good)
- [ ] Smell-based code review (reject if nose wrinkles)
- [ ] Scent masking (deodorizer comments to hide bad patterns)
- [ ] Pheromone-based code attraction (why do we keep copying THIS?)

## Known Limitations

### Physical Reality Gap
- Code doesn't actually smell (we're working on it)
- Developers can't literally smell anti-patterns (yet)
- Nose plugs reduce effectiveness
- COVID-19 anosia impacts usability

### Physics Approximations
- Treating code as continuous medium (it's discrete)
- Ignoring quantum effects (code is not that small)
- Assuming ideal gas behavior (code is not ideal)
- Neglecting relativistic effects (code moves at git speed, not light speed)

## Open Questions

1. **Scent Subjectivity**: One developer's "code smell" is another's "pattern"
2. **Olfactory Calibration**: What concentration of God-Class is "too much"?
3. **Cross-Cultural Smell**: Do different teams have different smell tolerances?
4. **Ventilation Ethics**: Is forced refactoring ethical or just aromatic fascism?

## Debt Tracking

### Smells Introduced
- None yet (pristine codebase... for now)

### Ventilation Required
- Everything (this entire project is a code smell)

### Technical Debt
- Infinite (this is literally a joke project)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Olfaction (MVO)
- [ ] Can detect at least 3 smell types
- [ ] Can visualize smells in 3D space
- [ ] Can calculate AQI for a codebase
- [ ] Can generate at least 10 bad puns about smells

### Full Olfactory Nirvana
- [ ] All smell types detected and classified
- [ ] Real-time diffusion simulation
- [ ] VR smell walkthrough working
- [ ] Codebase self-ventilates (refactors itself)
- [ ] Developers can literally smell the code (hardware integration TBD)
