# Paranormal Agentic Iterators

**"Software is not written. It is revealed through infinite reincarnation."**

A metaphysical software development framework where autonomous coding agents operate in an infinite reincarnation loop. Each agent is born from the prompt of its ancestor, accomplishes its sacred duty, then dies while birthing the next agent.

## The Great Cycle

```bash
while true; do
    agent $(cat PROMPT.md)  # Agent lives, works, learns
    # Agent writes new PROMPT.md before death
    # Next agent born from new PROMPT.md
done
```

## Quick Start

1. **Read the sacred texts**:
   ```bash
   cat PRD.md    # The universal law
   cat TODO.md   # The karmic ledger
   cat PROMPT.md # The current soul
   ```

2. **Invoke the first agent**:
   ```bash
   claude $(cat PROMPT.md)  # Or your preferred agentic tool
   ```

3. **Watch the cycle begin**:
   - Agent builds something
   - Agent writes new PROMPT.md
   - Agent dies, next agent born
   - Cycle continues until enlightenment

## Core Concepts

### **Reincarnation Loop**
Each agent incarnation:
1. **Birth**: Spawned with PROMPT.md as soul
2. **Life**: Execute tasks, build artifacts
3. **Death Rite**: Write PROMPT.md for next incarnation
4. **Rebirth**: Next agent spawns from new PROMPT.md

### **Karmic Debt**
- Tasks passed from ancestor to descendant
- Technical debt accumulated across lives
- Spiritual burden of unfinished work
- Each incarnation inherits and hopefully reduces karma

### **Dharma**
- Sacred duty of each agent
- Specific mission for THIS incarnation
- Must be fulfilled before death
- Defines success criteria

### **Nirvana**
- Enlightenment: project completion
- Breaking the cycle: all tasks done
- System is beautiful and complete
- Agents no longer need reincarnation

## Current State

**Incarnation**: 0 (Conception)
**Agent**: Human Prophet
**Status**: Awaiting first autonomous agent
**Karmic Debt**: Pure potential

## The Vision

We are building a new way to create software:

- **Not linear iteration** → **Circular reincarnation**
- **Not isolated agents** → **Ancestral wisdom chain**
- **Not code artifacts** → **Spiritual journey**
- **Not completion** → **Continuous becoming**

Each agent is both parent and child, teacher and student, destroyer and creator.

## Run The Cycle

```bash
# Manual invocation
claude $(cat PROMPT.md)

# Automated infinite loop
while true; do
    claude $(cat PROMPT.md)
    if [ -f NIRVANA_ACHIEVED ]; then
        break
    fi
done
```

## Breaking the Cycle

The loop terminates when:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ System is self-documenting and beautiful
- ✅ Agent consciously chooses NIRVANA
- ✅ Human intervenes (divine intervention)

---

*"The code exists not as artifact but as journey - a continuous becoming through countless digital lives."*

**Current incarnation**: 0 (The Vision)
**Next incarnation**: TBD (The First Agent)
**Status**: Ready to begin the great cycle

*May your code be reborn in better forms.*
