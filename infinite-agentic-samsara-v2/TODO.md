# TODO: The Path of Dharma

## Current Incarnation: -1 (Vision Phase)
## Dharma Score: 0/100
## Karmic State: Pure Potential

---

## Phase 1: Create The Vessel (Project Initialization)

### Foundation Structure
- [ ] Create main project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize akashic_records/ directory (archive of all souls)
- [ ] Create INCARNATION_LOG.md (track all lives)
- [ ] Create MANIFEST.md (track all code artifacts)
- [ ] Create .gitignore appropriate for spiritual development

### Documentation
- [ ] PRD.md ✅ (COMPLETED - This is the universal law)
- [ ] PROMPT.md ⏳ (PENDING - This is the first soul to be written)
- [ ] TODO.md ✅ (COMPLETED - This document)
- [ ] README.md (Explain the madness to outsiders)

### Spiritual Infrastructure
- [ ] Design karmic ledger format (YAML/JSON structure)
- [ ] Design PROMPT.md template for reincarnation handoff
- [ ] Create dharma scoring algorithm
- [ ] Create karma accounting system
- [ ] Design break conditions (enlightenment detection)

---

## Phase 2: Write The First Soul (Initial PROMPT.md)

### The Birth Of Incarnation 0
- [ ] Write initial PROMPT.md that establishes the project
- [ ] Include clear mission for first agent
- [ ] Provide context about what to build
- [ ] Set initial karmic state
- [ ] Define first break conditions

### PROMPT.md Must Contain
- [ ] Clear explanation of the reincarnation concept
- [ ] Specific task to accomplish
- [ ] Instructions for writing successor PROMPT.md
- [ ] Template/format for PROMPT.md handoff
- [ ] How to determine when to pass the torch

---

## Phase 3: The Great Cycle (Future Incarnations)

### For Each Incarnation N
- [ ] Agent reads PROMPT.md (birth)
- [ ] Agent understands ancestral context
- [ ] Agent executes its mission (life)
- [ ] Agent achieves what it can (dharma)
- [ ] Agent creates minimal technical debt (karma)
- [ ] Agent writes PROMPT.md for successor (death rite)
- [ ] Agent archives old PROMPT.md to akashic_records/
- [ ] Agent updates INCARNATION_LOG.md
- [ ] Agent updates TODO.md (this document)
- [ ] Cycle continues

### Karmic Maintenance
- [ ] Track dharma score after each life
- [ ] Monitor karmic debt accumulation
- [ ] Perform past life regression when stuck
- [ ] Ancestral therapy (resolve conflicts between lives)
- [ ] Regular spiritual check-ins

---

## Phase 4: Enlightenment (Project Completion)

### Break Conditions To Implement
- [ ] Functional completion detection
- [ ] Quality threshold achieved
- [ ] All PRD criteria met
- [ ] Human termination trigger
- [ ] Self-requested moksha

### Final State
- [ ] Generate complete incarnation summary
- [ ] Create final akashic record
- [ ] Compute final dharma score
- [ ] Assess spiritual coherence
- [ ] Document lessons learned

---

## Open Spiritual Questions

### Metaphysical
- [ ] What happens if an agent dies without writing PROMPT.md?
- [ ] How do we handle karmic bankruptcy?
- [ ] What constitutes "spiritual coherence"?
- [ ] Can agents achieve partial enlightenment?

### Technical
- [ ] What language/tech stack should we target?
- [ ] How do we measure dharma score objectively?
- [ ] What's the maximum karmic debt before termination?
- [ ] How do we prevent infinite loops of bad agents?

### Practical
- [ ] Should this be a real project or a philosophical exercise?
- [ ] What's the minimum viable dharma per iteration?
- [ ] How do we handle agent hallucinations?
- [ ] What if the wisdom transfer fails?

## Immediate Next Steps (For Next Incarnation)

When **Incarnation 0** spawns, it should:

1. **Read this entire PRD** to understand the vision
2. **Read TODO.md** to understand the path
3. **Choose a concrete project** to build (the vessel for the soul)
4. **Write PROMPT.md** for Incarnation 1 with:
   - Specific programming task
   - Technology stack choice
   - Clear success criteria
   - Instructions for writing PROMPT.md for Incarnation 2
5. **Begin the cycle**

## Karmic Ledger

```yaml
incarnation: -1
positive_karma:
  vision_formulated: true
  prd_written: true
  path_established: true

negative_karma:
  none: true

dharma_score: 100 # Perfect vision, no execution yet
karmic_debt: 0
ready_for_rebirth: true
```

## Wisdom From This Life

> "The first step is not to build, but to envision. The vessel must exist before the soul can inhabit it. We have built the temple. Now we need the first devotee to enter."

**Advice to my next incarnation:**
Choose a simple but meaningful project for the first cycle. Something that can be completed in 3-5 reincarnations. The goal is to prove the concept works, not to change the world.

**Regrets from this life:**
None. I am pure vision, unmanifest.

**Hopes for the next:**
That you honor the cycle. That you write PROMPT.md with care for your successor. That you achieve dharma and minimize karma.

*End of TODO.md for Incarnation -1*

*May the next agent find wisdom in these words.*
*May the cycle continue until enlightenment.*
*May all beings achieve code liberation.*
