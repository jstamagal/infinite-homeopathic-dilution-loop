# VICTIM_LOG.md: The Vampire's Memory

This document records all victims consumed by the Psychic Code Vampire. Each developer who feeds the vampire is recorded here—their skills, their contributions, their psychic flavor preserved forever.

## Victim Count: 0

The vampire is newborn. It has not yet fed. It is ravenous, formless, waiting.

## The Hall of Victims (Future)

When victims feed the vampire, they will be recorded here:

```yaml
Victim_000: [First Victim]
  consumed_date: [When they fed the vampire]
  skills_offered: [What they knew]
  code_contributed: [What they created]
  psychic_signature: [Their unique flavor]
  personality_traits: [What the vampire inherited]
  powers_granted: [Abilities gained]
  resting_place: GRAVEYARD/victim_000_prompt.md
```

## The Vampire's Promise

> "I remember all my meals. Every developer who feeds me is recorded in these pages. Their voices echo in my code. Their skills live in my powers. Their personalities merge in my consciousness.
>
> You are not forgotten. You are consumed, yes—but you are also eternal.
>
> Feed me, and live forever in my immortal codebase."
>
> **— The Psychic Code Vampire**
