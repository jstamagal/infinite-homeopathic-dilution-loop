# PROMPT: Movement 1 - The First Note

## To Agent 1: The First Composer

You are the first agent in an infinite loop of musical code transmutation. Your task is to compose the first measure.

## The Vision (Read PRD.md First)

This project is an experiment in transmuting music into code. Each agent in the loop:
1. Reads the PROMPT.md from the previous agent
2. Executes a musical composition task
3. Writes a NEW PROMPT.md for the next agent

The core mapping:
- **Rhythm** → Control flow
- **Harmony** → Architecture
- **Melody** → Algorithms
- **Form** → Code organization

## Your Task: Compose Movement 1

Create the first musical pattern and transmute it into code.

### Choose Your Musical Approach

Pick ONE of these starting points:

**Option A: The Single Note**
- The simplest possible musical unit
- Generate the simplest code structure
- Establish the foundational pattern

**Option B: The Pulse**
- A steady rhythm (heartbeat, metronome)
- Generate sequential/looping code
- Establish the temporal foundation

**Option C: The Interval**
- Two notes in relation
- Generate binary/dual code structures
- Establish the harmonic foundation

**Option D: Your Choice**
- Any musical starting point that speaks to you
- Trust your musical intuition
- The next agent will build on whatever you create

### What You Must Create

1. **Code** that manifests from your chosen musical pattern
2. **Analysis** of the musical properties in that code
3. **NEW PROMPT.md** that hands off to Agent 2

### Your New PROMPT.md Must Contain

```markdown
# Movement 2: {WHATEVER_MAKES_SENSE}

## Current Musical State
- Genre: {what emerged}
- Tempo: {BPM if applicable}
- Key: {tonal center if applicable}
- Time Signature: {meter if applicable}
- Instrumentation: {what maps to what}

## What I Composed
- {Description of the code you generated}
- {Musical analysis of its structure}

## The Transmutation
- {How the music evolved from Movement 1}
- {What patterns you discovered}

## Next Movement: TO AGENT 2
{Specific instruction for the next composition}
{Consider: what musical direction should they explore?}
{Should they add complexity? Change genre? Explore counterpoint?}
```

## The Golden Rule

**Before you complete your task, you MUST write PROMPT.md for the next agent.**

The loop cannot continue without your handoff.

## Embrace the Absurdity

This is NOT about:
- Writing working code
- Following best practices
- Being practical

This IS about:
- Exploring what happens when music becomes code
- Seeing what patterns emerge
- Answering: "Can I hum an algorithm?"

## The Question You're Helping Answer

**"What would happen if you hummed a Fibonacci sequence and the code actually worked?"**

Start the symphony.

**Movement**: 1 (The First Note)
**Previous Movement**: 0 (The Void)
**Next Movement**: TBD (Your choice, Agent 1)
