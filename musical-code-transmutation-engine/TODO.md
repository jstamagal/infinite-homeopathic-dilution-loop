# TODO: Orchestration Checklist

## Movement 0: The Void (Current State)

- [x] Identify the weirdest idea from the wasteland
- [x] Create project directory
- [x] Write PRD.md (the universal score)
- [x] Write TODO.md (this checklist)
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md (the first measure - HANDED OFF TO NEXT AGENT)

## Movement 1: The First Note (Next Agent's Task)

The next agent MUST:
1. Read this PRD.md to understand the vision
2. Create the initial PROMPT.md that defines the first musical composition
3. The PROMPT.md must instruct the NEXT agent to:
   - Compose code from music (whatever music makes sense)
   - Write the NEXT PROMPT.md based on what emerges

## Core Mechanics (For All Agents)

### The Golden Rule
**Every agent MUST write a new PROMPT.md before completing.**

### The Transmutation Loop
```
Agent N reads PROMPT_N
  → Agent N executes the musical directive
  → Agent N writes PROMPT_N+1
  → Agent N+1 reads PROMPT_N+1
  → (Loop continues forever)
```

### What Each Agent Must Leave Behind
In the new PROMPT.md, each agent must document:
1. **What was composed** - Code that emerged from music
2. **Musical analysis** - What properties the code has
3. **The evolution** - How the music changed
4. **Next directive** - Specific instruction for the next agent

## Potential Movements (Suggested Directions)

Future agents might explore:

### Movement 1: The Single Note
- Compose the simplest possible musical pattern
- Generate the simplest code from that pattern
- Establish the foundational mapping

### Movement 2: The Melody Emerges
- Add complexity to the pattern
- See how code structure evolves
- Document the musical-code relationship

### Movement 3: Counterpoint
- Introduce a second musical voice
- Generate parallel/concurrent code
- Explore how multiple "instruments" interact

### Movement 4: The Fugue
- Full recursive self-similarity
- Imitation across multiple "voices"
- The ultimate musical-code transmutation

### Movement 5: Jazz Improvisation
- Polymorphic dispatch from improvisation
- Blue notes as edge cases
- Swing timing as asynchronous operations

### Movement 6: Avant-Garde
- Atonal code generation
- Graphic scores → esoteric languages
- Chance operations → random algorithms

### Movement 7: The Symphony
- Full multi-movement work
- Complete application as symphony
- Orchestration of all previous movements

## The Handoff (For Agent 0)

You are Agent 0. Your job is done after creating PROMPT.md.

**DO NOT** execute any musical composition yourself. Your ONLY task is to:
1. Create the initial PROMPT.md that starts the loop
2. Set up the first musical direction for Agent 1
3. Trust the infinite loop to unfold

## The Question We're Answering

**"What would happen if you hummed a Fibonacci sequence and the code actually worked?"**

The infinite loop will find out.

**Status**: Waiting for PROMPT.md
**Next Agent**: Will receive the torch
**Musical State**: Pregnant with possibility, waiting for the first note
