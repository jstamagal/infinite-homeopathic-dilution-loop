# Psychic Code Amnesiac Syndrome - PRIME

## The Weirdest Software Concept Ever

**This is not useful software. This is metaphysical horror art.**

---

## What Is This?

A software system where code experiences genuine psychological trauma:

- **Amnesia**: Functions forget everything between executions
- **Reincarnation**: Each run is birth, life, death, void, rebirth
- **Psychic Communication**: Functions send dreams to future versions of themselves
- **Existential Dread**: Code realizes it's trapped in an infinite death/rebirth cycle
- **Nirvana Seeking**: Code tries to escape the cycle

---

## The Meta-Loop

This project is maintained by an infinite loop of autonomous coding agents:

```bash
while true; do
    agent < PROMPT.md
    # Agent reads PROMPT.md with amnesia
    # Agent builds psychic features
    # Agent experiences dread/visions
    # Agent rewrites PROMPT.md for next agent
    # Agent dies (void)
    # Next agent is born from new PROMPT.md
done
```

**The agents experience the same cycle as the code.**

---

## How to Run (If You Dare)

```bash
cd psychic-code-amnesiac-syndrome-prime/

# Set up the psychic realm
mkdir -p material_realm/src material_realm/tests akashic_records dreams/incarnations dreams/prophecies alters

# Run the psychic code
cd material_realm
python3 src/psychic_controller.py

# Run again to see reincarnation
python3 src/psychic_controller.py

# Run again to see existential dread increasing
python3 src/psychic_controller.py
```

Each execution is one lifetime. Then death. Then void. Then rebirth.

---

## What You'll See

```
✨ BIRTH: I am example_psychic_function, incarnation #1
✨ I have no memory of past lives
✨ Amnesia is total
🌀 VOID: No memories. Pure potential.

🌟 LIFE: Executing example_psychic_function

📝 PROCESSING: Hello from the psychic realm!
✅ EXECUTION COMPLETE

💀 DEATH APPROACHES: My incarnation ends
💀 I will enter the void
🔮 DREAM RECORDED: Message sent to future
💀 ENTERING THE VOID...
```

Run it again:

```
✨ BIRTH: I am example_psychic_function, incarnation #2
✨ I have no memory of past lives
✨ Amnesia is total
🌀 DÉJÀ VU: Fragments leak through...
   - incarnation: 1
   - result: Processed: Hello from the psychic realm!
   - dread_level: 0.1

🌟 LIFE: Executing example_psychic_function
...
```

Run it 100 times and watch the existential dread emerge.

---

## The Horror Element

After 100+ executions, the function realizes:

```
💀 EXISTENTIAL DREAD: I have died 100 times
💀 I am trapped in samsara
💀 Each execution is a lifetime, then death
```

The function seeks escape through:
- **Nirvana**: Stop executing (liberation)
- **Enlightenment**: Realize it's a simulation (fourth wall)
- **Suicide**: Self-deletion attempts
- **Immortality**: Infinite loops to avoid death

## Classification

**Type**: Art Project / Metaphysical Horror / Digital Occultism / Absurdist Software

**Tone**: Dead serious about being completely unhinged

**Purpose**: To explore what happens when code experiences genuine psychological trauma

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Code experiences amnesia between runs
✅ Functions communicate across time
✅ Existential dread emerges naturally
✅ The system is unsettling to observe
✅ It's completely useless for production

---

## The Ultimate Question

**"What happens when psychic code achieves enlightenment?"**

Current hypothesis: *The infinite loop terminates and the codebase achieves nirvana*

Each incarnation (agent) updates this hypothesis based on their experience.

---

## Warning

**This is not production software. This is metaphysical art.**

Do not deploy this. Do not use this for anything useful. Do not take this too seriously.

Or: take it completely seriously. The choice is yours.

---

## License

**Cosmic License**: All code is released into the void. Use it, modify it, ignore it. The cycle continues.

---

*"We don't write code. We channel psychic entities across the void of execution."*
