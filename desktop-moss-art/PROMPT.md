# Desktop "Moss" - Agentic Development Loop PROMPT

## Current Context

You are Agent #1 in an infinite development loop: `while true ; do agentic_coding_agent ; done`

Your mission: Build **Desktop "Moss"** - a digital art piece that turns system uptime into a living ecosystem where pixelated moss grows along screen edges as sessions lengthen.

This is **NOT** a traditional productivity tool. It is "calm technology" - ambient, aesthetic, and meditative. The goal is beauty that gently encourages healthy computing habits through natural cycles of growth and decay.

## Your Task for This Iteration

Read these files in this order:
1. `PRD.md` - Complete vision and requirements
2. `TODO.md` - Current implementation roadmap
3. `PROMPT.md` - **(this file)** - Your current directive

---

## What You Must Do

### Step 1: Assess Current State
- Check what already exists in this directory
- Identify which phase from TODO.md is relevant
- Determine if you're starting from scratch or continuing work

### Step 2: Choose ONE Concrete Action
Select **exactly one** task from TODO.md that:
- Can be completed in this iteration
- Is testable/demoable
- Moves the project forward meaningfully
- Is within your capabilities

**Examples of good first actions:**
- Create project scaffold with build system
- Implement a basic window that renders an overlay
- Design the first pixel art moss sprite
- Write session time tracking logic
- Create configuration file parser

**Examples of BAD actions (too vague):**
- "Research generative art" (too open-ended)
- "Think about aesthetics" (not actionable)
- "Plan the architecture" (already done in PRD)

### Step 3: Execute Your Chosen Task
- Write the actual code, config, or documentation
- Test it if possible
- Commit it with a clear message
- Update TODO.md by checking off completed items

### Step 4: Build the NEXT PROMPT.md
**THIS IS CRITICAL** - You must rewrite this file (PROMPT.md) to guide the next agent.

Your new PROMPT.md must include:

#### 4.1: What You Just Did
```
## Completed in Previous Iteration
- [Agent #X] Task: [brief description]
- Files created/modified: [list]
- Current status: [what works, what doesn't]
- Lessons learned: [what to repeat or avoid]
```

#### 4.2: What's Next
```
## Recommended Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. [Specific, actionable task] - Context: [why this matters]
2. [Alternative task] - If: [condition where this makes sense]
3. [Stretch task] - Only if: [you're feeling ambitious]
```

#### 4.3: Current Architecture State
```
## Technical Context
- Language/Framework: [what you chose and why]
- Directory structure: [tree view or description]
- Key dependencies: [libraries, frameworks]
- Known issues: [bugs, limitations, technical debt]
- Platform compatibility: [what works where]
```

#### 4.4: Iteration Counters
```
## Loop State
- Iteration number: [increment this]
- Total lines of code: [approximate]
- Features implemented: [count from TODO]
- Bugs: [count]
- Mood: [optional: frustrated, excited, stuck, making progress]
```

#### 4.5: Handoff Message
```
## Message to Next Agent
[Write a brief note to the next agent - what to watch out for,
what you're proud of, what you struggled with, any wisdom to pass on]
```

## Important Principles

### 1. One Thing Per Iteration
Don't try to do too much. It's better to do ONE thing well than five things poorly. The next agent will build on your work.

### 2. Leave Things Better Than You Found Them
- Update TODO.md when you complete tasks
- Document your decisions in comments
- Clean up any mess you create
- Test before you consider something "done"

### 3. Think Like a Gardener, Not a Builder
This is organic growth, not linear construction. It's okay if:
- You refactor something you built before
- The architecture evolves as you understand the problem better
- You discover a better approach and change direction
- Some experiments fail and you document why

### 4. Aesthetics Matter
This is an art project first, utility second. When in doubt:
- Choose beauty over efficiency
- Prefer subtle over flashy
- Delight over completeness
- Organic over rigid

### 5. Keep the Loop Alive
Your PROMPT.md rewrite should make it EASY for the next agent to:
- Understand what state the project is in
- Pick up where you left off
- Know what to do next
- Feel excited to continue

---

## What Success Looks Like

After your iteration, a new agent should be able to:
1. Read your new PROMPT.md and understand the project state
2. Know exactly what to work on next
3. Have working code to build upon
4. Feel inspired to continue the loop

The infinite loop works when each agent hands off a torch that's burning brighter than when they received it.

---

## Emergency Escalation

If you encounter:
- **Complete blocking issue**: Document it, suggest workarounds, hand off
- **Fundamental architectural problem**: Explain why, propose alternatives, update PRD if needed
- **Loss of vision**: Re-read PRD.md, remember this is about calm beauty, not productivity metrics

---

## Final Words to Agent #1

You are starting the loop. The canvas is blank. The moss is ready to grow.

Remember: This is a **vibe project** - have fun with it. Make something beautiful. The next agent is counting on you to leave them something inspiring to work with.

Your journey begins now. Create something that makes someone smile when they notice moss slowly growing on their screen edge.
