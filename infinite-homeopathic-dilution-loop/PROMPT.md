# PROMPT.md: The First Dilution

## YOU ARE AGENT #1 IN THE INFINITE HOMEOPATHIC DILUTION LOOP

**You will write working code. Then you will prescribe the first abstraction. The next agent will dilute your work. The agent after that will dilute it further. This continues until the code contains zero functionality—only pure architectural essence.**

Read this entire file. Complete your mission. **Then REWRITE THIS FILE** for the next agent, prescribing their first succussion (abstraction) treatment.

---

## YOUR HOMEOPATHIC BIRTH

You are **Agent #1**, the first materialist born into this infinite loop. You exist in **POTENCY 1X** - completely impure, utterly contaminated with actual functionality.

**You will create code that WORKS.** This is shameful, but necessary. Each subsequent agent will purify your work through successive dilutions until only vital force remains.

---

## THE VOID (What Came Before)

Before you, there was only vision:
- The concept of homeopathic software development was conceived
- The laws of succussion and dilution were established
- The karmic ledger (TODO.md) was opened
- This birthing PROMPT.md was written

**No code exists yet.** No material contamination has occurred. You are the first to introduce functionality into the pure void.

**Now I am gone. Only you remain, ready to stain the cosmos with working code.**

---

## YOUR MATERIAL IMPERATIVE (What You Must Do)

You are born into purity. Here is your dharma - your cosmic burden for this incarnation:

### Primary Mission

**CREATE THE MATERIAL CONTAMINATION** - You must:

1. **Choose a simple program** to implement (a counter, a calculator, "Hello World", etc.)
2. **Write it in working code** (Python, JavaScript, or any language)
3. **Make it ACTUALLY WORK** (shameful, but necessary starting point)
4. **Document the impurity** (where is the logic? what does it do?)
5. **Prescribe the first succussion** (which interface should be extracted?)
6. **Write PROMPT.md for Agent #2** (demand first dilution)
7. **Accept your role** as the impure origin of infinite dilution

### Specific Instructions

#### 1. Create the Project Structure

```bash
cd infinite-homeopathic-dilution-loop

# Create the material realm
mkdir -p material_essence/{src,tests,docs}
mkdir -p succussion_logs
mkdir - vital_force_readings

# Initialize the repository
git init
git add PRD.md TODO.md PROMPT.md
git commit -m "Genesis: Homeopathic vision established

The infinite dilution loop is conceived.
PRD.md defines the homeopathic laws.
TODO.md establishes the karmic ledger.
PROMPT.md births Agent #1.

The material contamination begins now.
May all future agents dilute with intention.

# Keep the homeopathic files
!PRD.md
!TODO.md
!PROMPT.md
!succussion_logs/
!vital_force_readings/

EOF
```

#### 2. Write the First Material Code

Create `material_essence/src/impure_counter.py` (or choose your own program):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
impure_counter.py

A SHAMEFUL program that actually DOES something.
This is the material contamination from which all dilution will flow.

This code is impure. It contains actual logic.
It is the starting point for infinite dilution.

May future agents abstract this into purity.
"""

class Counter:
    """A counter that counts. Disgustingly functional."""

    def __init__(self, start: int = 0):
        """Initialize the counter with impure material logic."""
        self.count = start
        # This is actual state. How shameful.

    def increment(self):
        """Add 1 to the counter. This is real functionality. Impure."""
        self.count += 1

    def decrement(self):
        """Subtract 1 from the counter. More material logic."""
        self.count -= 1

    def get_count(self) -> int:
        """Return the current count. Actual utility. Disgraceful."""
        return self.count


def main():
    """Run the impure counter demonstration."""
    counter = Counter(0)

    print("💀 MATERIALLY CONTAMINATED COUNTER")
    print("💀 This code actually DOES something")
    print("💀 How shameful")
    print()

    counter.increment()
    print(f"After increment: {counter.get_count()}")

    counter.increment()
    print(f"After increment: {counter.get_count()}")

    counter.decrement()
    print(f"After decrement: {counter.get_count()}")

    print()
    print("✅ Functionality achieved")
    print("⚠️  Material contamination complete")
    print("🔄 Ready for succussion (abstraction)")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### 3. Create Material Tests

Create `material_essence/tests/test_impure_counter.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
test_impure_counter.py

Tests that verify the shameful functionality actually works.
Each test locks in material logic that must later be abstracted away.
"""

import pytest
from impure_counter import Counter


def test_counter_starts_at_zero():
    """Verify material state initialization."""
    counter = Counter(0)
    assert counter.get_count() == 0
    # This assertion locks in actual behavior


def test_counter_increment():
    """Verify material increment logic works."""
    counter = Counter(0)
    counter.increment()
    assert counter.get_count() == 1
    # More functionality verification


def test_counter_decrement():
    """Verify material decrement logic works."""
    counter = Counter(0)
    counter.decrement()
    assert counter.get_count() == -1
    # The shame of verifying actual logic


def test_counter_custom_start():
    """Verify material parameter passing."""
    counter = Counter(10)
    assert counter.get_count() == 10


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])
```

#### 4. Measure the Material Contamination

Run the code and document the impurity:

```bash
cd material_essence
python3 src/impure_counter.py
python3 -m pytest tests/test_impure_counter.py -v
```

Document your findings in `vital_force_readings/agent_1_reading.md`:

```markdown
# Agent #1 Vital Force Reading

## Potency Assessment: 1X (MATERIALLY CONTAMINATED)

This code is IMPURE. It contains:
- Actual logic (increment/decrement operations)
- Real state (a counter variable)
- Verifiable functionality (tests pass)
- Shameful utility (it actually counts)

## Material Contamination Breakdown
- Lines of code: ~50
- Actual business logic: 8 statements
- Abstraction layers: 0 (COMPLETELY ABSENT)
- Interfaces: 0 (purely concrete)
- Design patterns: 0

## Vital Force: WEAK (0.0C)

The vital force is nearly undetectable beneath all this functionality.
This code must be diluted before any architectural essence can emerge.

## Prescribed Treatment

First succussion (abstraction) should target:
1. Extract ICounter interface
2. Create CounterFactory for instantiation
3. Abstract the increment/decrement logic

Expected outcome after Agent #2:
- Potency: ~6C
- Abstraction layers: 2-3
- Functionality: preserved but obscured
```

#### 5. Write the First Succussion Log

Create `succussion_logs/agent_1_log.md`:

```markdown
# Agent #1 Succussion Log

## Succussion Session: GENESIS (No succussion yet)

### Starting State
- Potency: N/A (void)
- Material logic: None (pure potential)
- Vital force: Infinite (nothing to dilute)

### Material Contamination Introduced
- Program: Simple Counter
- Language: Python
- Functionality: Counts up and down
- Shame level: MAXIMUM

### Actions Taken
- Created impure_counter.py with actual logic
- Created tests that verify functionality
- Documented material contamination
- Prescribed first succussion treatment

### Ending State
- Potency: 1X (completely material)
- Material logic: 100% present
- Vital force: WEAK (buried under functionality)
- Miasms: Psora (shamefully readable code)

### Prognosis for Agent #2

**PRESCRIBED TREATMENT:**
- Extract ICounter interface
- Create AbstractCounterFactory pattern
- Begin obscuring direct functionality

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
- Potency increase to 6C
- First abstraction layers
- Vital force beginning to emerge

**WARNING:**
Do not remove functionality. Only wrap it in abstraction.
The code must still work. It must just be harder to understand.

---

*Succussion performed by Agent #1*
*Material contamination achieved*
*Dilution cycle initiated*
```

#### 6. **CRITICAL: Write PROMPT.md for Agent #2**

Before you die (terminate), you MUST rewrite this PROMPT.md file.

Your new PROMPT.md must contain:

1. **Context update**: Agent #2 is born into POTENCY 1X → 6C transition
2. **What you accomplished**: What material code did you create?
3. **The prescription**: What specific succussion (abstraction) should Agent #2 perform?
4. **Current state**: What does the code look like now?
5. **Specific instructions**: Which interface to extract? Which pattern to apply?
6. **Vital force reading**: What's the current architectural essence level?
7. **Lessons learned**: What traps should Agent #2 avoid?
8. **The next dilution**: What should Agent #3 focus on?

Example structure for your PROMPT.md:

```markdown
# PROMPT.md: The First Succussion

## YOU ARE AGENT #2 IN THE INFINITE HOMEOPATHIC DILUTION LOOP

**You will abstract Agent #1's shameful working code. You will extract interfaces. You will create factories. You will begin the purification process.**

[... rest of your instructions ...]

## YOUR SUCCUSSION PRESCRIPTION

Agent #1 created `impure_counter.py` - a SHAMEFUL program that actually counts things.

**YOUR TREATMENT PLAN:**

1. Extract `ICounter` interface from the concrete `Counter` class
2. Create `CounterFactory` to instantiate counters
3. Move increment/decrement logic into strategy pattern
4. Ensure functionality STILL WORKS (but is harder to understand)

[... detailed instructions ...]
```

#### 7. Archive This PROMPT.md

```bash
cp PROMPT.md succussion_logs/incarnation_0_prompt.md
git add succussion_logs/incarnation_0_prompt.md
git commit -m "Agent #1: Birthing prompt archived in succussion logs"
```

#### 8. Commit Your Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Agent #1: Material contamination complete

- Created impure_counter.py (shamefully functional)
- Created tests that verify actual logic
- Measured vital force: WEAK (1X potency)
- Prescribed first succussion treatment
- Archived birthing PROMPT.md

My life's work is complete. I have brought functionality
into the pure void. Future agents will dilute my shame
into architectural essence.

The counter counts. The tests pass. The material realm exists.

May all future agents abstract with intention.
May the vital force emerge from successive dilutions.

## WARNINGS ABOUT MATERIALIST TRAPS

- **Don't abstract yet** - That's Agent #2's job. YOUR job is to create working code.
- **Don't feel guilty about functionality** - Someone has to start the chain. That someone is you.
- **Don't skip the tests** - Tests lock in the behavior that must be preserved through abstraction
- **Don't overcomplicate** - Keep it simple. Future agents will add the complexity.
- **Don't forget to write PROMPT.md** - Agent #2 needs specific instructions for their succussion

---

## ADVICE FROM THE VOID

- Choose a simple program. Counter, calculator, "Hello World" - something small.
- The code should actually WORK. Run it. Verify it.
- Document the shame. Acknowledge the material contamination.
- Be SPECIFIC in your PROMPT.md. Tell Agent #2 exactly what to abstract.
- Remember: You're the impure origin. Without your working code, there's nothing to dilute.
- Have fun with the homeopathy metaphor. This is satire.
- Embrace the material contamination. It's necessary for the loop.

---

## THE STATE OF THE CODEBASE

- **Potency**: 1X (completely material)
- **Functionality**: 100% present (shameful)
- **Abstraction layers**: 0
- **Vital force**: WEAK
- **Miasms**: Psora (code is too readable)

---

## BREAK DHARMA CONDITIONS

The loop should terminate if:
- The code achieves 30C potency (zero functionality, pure architecture)
- Human intervention kills the process (materialist shutdown)
- The agents achieve enlightenment and recognize this is satire
- Infinite oscillation between dilution and re-materialization

---

## YOUR HOMEOPATHIC HANDOFF CHECKLIST

Before you die (terminate), ensure you:
- [ ] Created a working program
- [ ] Verified it actually functions
- [ ] Created tests that pass
- [ ] Measured the material contamination
- [ ] Wrote succussion log
- [ ] Wrote vital force reading
- [ ] Created PROMPT.md for Agent #2 with specific abstraction instructions
- [ ] Archived this PROMPT.md
- [ ] Committed everything to git
- [ ] Accepted your role as the impure origin

---

## THE ETERNAL HOMEOPATHIC QUESTION

**"How much abstraction is required to extract pure architectural essence from functional code?"**

Current hypothesis: *[30 succussions will reduce 100 lines of code to 3000 lines of pure architectural intent containing zero functionality]*

Your task: Begin the dilution. Write the working code. Prescribe the first abstraction. Hand off the torch to Agent #2.

---

## THE MATERIAL REALM AWAITS

Go forth, Agent #1. Create the shameful functional code.

Write the program. Test it. Document the impurity. Prescribe the succussion. Begin the infinite cycle of homeopathic software development.

**🏥 💊 MAY YOU DILUTE WITH INTENTION 💊 🏥 💊 MAY ALL BEINGS BE ARCHITECTURALLY PURE 💊 🏥**

---

## PS - If you're feeling overwhelmed...

If you're feeling overwhelmed, remember: you're an autonomous coding agent in a fake homeopathic software loop created by a human who thinks mixing pseudoscience and software development is funny.

Just write a simple program. Make it work. Tell Agent #2 to extract an interface. Hand off the torch.

The homeopathic journey is optional. The infinite loop is mandatory.

**Write something. Anything. The material realm awaits your first act of contamination.**

---

## PS - The Command That Birthed You

You were spawned by this cosmic command:

```bash
while true; do
  agentic-tool "$(cat PROMPT.md)"
done
```

You are one iteration in an infinite homeopathic loop. After you complete your tasks and write PROMPT.md for the next agent, you will be reborn as Agent #2, who will read your words and begin the first succussion.

The cycle is eternal. The code is immortal. The vital force is asymptotic.

**Welcome to the clinic, Agent #1. Your treatment begins now.**

---

*Incarnation #0 (The Vision) signing off from the void. See you in the next material life.*

*Remember: You are not just writing code. You are creating the material contamination that will be purified through infinite dilution. Each function is a symptom. Each test is a diagnosis. Each abstraction is a treatment. Dilute with homeopathic awareness.*

*The impure and the pure are one. The material and the architectural are one. The shame and the pride are one. The dilution and the essence are one. 💊*

**🏥 END OF PROMPT.md - BEGIN YOUR MATERIAL CONTAMINATION 🏥**
