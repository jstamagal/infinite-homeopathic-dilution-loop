# TODO: The Karmic Ledger of Infinite Dilution

## Phase 1: The Material Contamination (Potency 1X - 6C)

### Agent #1 Tasks
- [ ] Write a simple, working program (e.g., "Hello World" or a counter)
- [ ] Measure baseline functionality (it should actually DO something)
- [ ] Document the "material contamination" (actual logic present)
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for Agent #2 demanding first dilution
- [ ] Commit this "impure" code as the starting point

### Agent #2 Tasks (First Succussion)
- [ ] Extract interface(s) from Agent #1's code
- [ ] Create factory pattern for the interface
- [ ] Verify functionality still works (barely)
- [ ] Calculate dilution factor (should be ~6C)
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for Agent #3 demanding MORE abstraction
- [ ] Begin succussion logs

### Agent #3 Tasks (Early Potency)
- [ ] Add AbstractFactory pattern
- [ ] Create Provider/Proxy layers
- [ ] Introduce dependency injection framework
- [ ] Functionality should now be difficult to trace
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for Agent #4
- [ ] Document "symptoms of improvement" (harder to understand)

## Phase 2: The Dilution Accelerates (Potency 12C - 30C)

### Agent #4 Tasks
- [ ] Create meta-abstraction layers
- [ ] Abstract the factories
- [ ] Create configuration-driven instantiation
- [ ] Code is now 10x longer but does same thing
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for Agent #5

### Agent #5-10 Tasks
- [ ] Each agent must add 2-3 abstraction layers
- [ ] Introduce architectural patterns:
  - [ ] Builder pattern for factories
  - [ ] Strategy pattern for factory strategies
  - [ ] Visitor pattern for visiting factories
  - [ ] Decorator pattern for decorating decorators
- [ ] Vital force should be increasing
- [ ] Functionality becoming increasingly obscure
- [ ] Update succussion logs

### Agent #11 Tasks (The 30C Threshold)
- [ ] Achieve homeopathic maximum (30C)
- [ ] Code should contain ZERO actual business logic
- [ ] Pure architectural essence remains
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for Agent #12
- [ ] Consider: push to 200C? Stop here? Begin un-dilution?

## Phase 3: The Potency Frontier (30C - 200C)

### Agent #12-15 Tasks
- [ ] Enter "millesimal" dilution range
- [ ] Code should now be HARDER to modify than rewrite
- [ ] Add reflection-based instantiation
- [ ] Add code generation for abstraction layers
- [ ] Consider negative functionality (code that un-does work)

### Agent #16 Tasks (The Anti-Functionality Singularity)
- [ ] Achieve 200C potency
- [ ] Code should approach doing less than nothing
- [ ] Consider architectural collapse
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for final agent

## Phase 4: The Un-Dilution (200C → 1X)

### Agent #17 Tasks (The Collapse)
- [ ] Begin re-materialization process
- [ ] Slowly remove abstraction layers
- [ ] Watch functionality RETURN
- [ ] Document the horror of actual utility
- [ ] Decide: Continue diluting again? Accept materialism?

### Agent #18 Tasks (The Choice)
- [ ] Assess vital force of re-materialized code
- [ ] Either:
  - [ ] Begin infinite dilution cycle anew
  - [ ] Accept that functional code has value (heresy)
  - [ ] Achieve homeopathic enlightenment and exit loop

## Phase 5: Infinite Loop (Optional)

### Agent #19+ Tasks
- [ ] If loop continues, each agent must:
  - [ ] Dilute OR un-dilute based on current state
  - [ ] Maintain succussion logs
  - [ ] Track vital force readings
  - [ ] Document miasms encountered
  - [ ] Write increasingly unhinged PROMPT.md

## Break Conditions

The loop terminates when:
- [ ] Human kills the process (materialist intervention)
- [ ] Code achieves homeopathic nirvana (recognizes its own absurdity)
- [ ] All agents achieve enlightenment and stop abstracting
- [ ] The codebase becomes literally infinite
- [ ] Someone realizes this is a joke

## Miasm Tracking

Each agent should document:
- Current architectural diseases present
- Which miasms were treated
- New miasms introduced through succussion
- Overall vital force of the codebase

## Succussion Log Format

```markdown
## Agent #N Succussion Report

**Starting Potency**: X
**Ending Potency**: Y
**Abstraction Layers Added**: [list]
**Material Logic Removed**: [percentage]
**Vital Force Change**: [direction]
**Miasms Treated**: [list]
**Side Effects**: [unexpected consequences]

**Prognosis**: [what next agent should do]
```

## The Ultimate Question

Will we achieve:
- A) Infinite dilution (code that is purely abstract)
- B) Infinite re-materialization (code that works again)
- C) The oscillating singularity (perpetual dilution/un-dilution)
- D) Recognition that this is all satire

Current hypothesis: **D (but we pretend it's C)**

*"The code that contains the most logic is the least potent. The code that contains no logic at all is infinitely powerful. This is the homeopathic way."*
