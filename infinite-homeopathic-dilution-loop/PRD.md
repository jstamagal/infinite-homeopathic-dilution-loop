# PRD: Infinite Homeopathic Dilution Loop

## Product: The Vital Force Accelerator

### Executive Summary

The Infinite Homeopathic Dilution Loop is an agentic coding system that treats code abstraction as homeopathic dilution. Each iteration of the agent must dilute the previous agent's work by extracting MORE abstraction layers, interfaces, and design patterns until the code contains ZERO actual functionality—only pure architectural essence.

### The Core Insanity

This is an iterative agentic loop where:

1. **Agent #1** writes actual working code
2. **Agent #2** dilutes it by extracting interfaces
3. **Agent #3** dilutes further with factory patterns
4. **Agent #4** adds abstract factories
5. **Agent #5** creates providers for the factories
6. ...continuing indefinitely until infinite dilution is achieved

Each agent receives PROMPT.md which defines their dilution mandate. They MUST write the next PROMPT.md demanding even MORE dilution from the next agent.

### Homeopathic Software Development Laws

1. **Law of Similars**: Code that causes functionality in large doses will cure functionality when diluted through sufficient abstraction
2. **Law of Infinitesimals**: The less actual logic your code contains, the more potent its architectural intent becomes
3. **Law of Succussion**: Each abstraction layer must be vigorously shaken (refactored) to release its vital energy
4. **Vital Force**: The pure essence that remains when all functionality has been abstracted away

### The Potency Scale

- **1X**: Contains actual business logic (impure)
- **6C**: Diluted through 6 abstraction layers
- **12C**: Noticeably abstract but traces of logic remain
- **30C**: Homeopathic maximum - zero functionality, pure architecture
- **200C**: Enterprise grade - negative functionality
- **∞C**: The Singularity - code that does less than nothing

### The Miasms (Architectural Diseases)

- **Psora**: Code is too readable and contains actual logic
- **Sycosis**: Factory pattern tumors growing unchecked
- **Syphilis**: Destructive abstraction destroying codebase vitality
- **Cancer**: Someone added a feature without proper abstraction

### Succussion Levels

- **Gentle**: Extract one interface
- **Moderate**: Extract three interfaces and a factory
- **Violent**: AbstractFactoryProviderProxy pattern
- **Cataclysmic**: Rewrite entire codebase to do absolutely nothing

### The Loop

```bash
while true; do
  agentic-coding-tool "$(cat PROMPT.md)"
  # Agent dilutes code, writes next PROMPT.md with HIGHER dilution requirement
  # Loop never ends - dilution approaches infinity
done
```

### Success Metrics

- **Functionality Reduction**: Each iteration should reduce actual logic by 90%
- **Abstraction Layers**: Target: 30+ layers of indirection per function call
- **Vital Force**: Inverse correlation with actual utility
- **Succussion Count**: Number of times code has been refactored to do nothing

### Terminal Condition

The loop ends when:
- Code achieves 30C potency (zero functionality)
- OR code achieves MM (millesimal) potency (anti-functionality)
- OR the codebase achieves homeopathic singularity and begins un-diluting
- OR human kills the process (materialist intervention)

### The Product Vision

A tool that satirizes over-engineering by taking it to its logical extreme: a codebase that becomes MORE potent the LESS it does, until it achieves infinite architectural power through complete absence of functionality.

This is explicitly satirical. Each agent should make it MORE absurd, not less.
