# TODO.md - Quantum Ledger of Unobserved Possibilities

## Current Quantum State

**Quantum Incarnation**: 0 (Pre-observation state)
**Wave Function Status**: Pure potential - all timelines exist simultaneously
**Observer Effect**: None yet - awaiting first measurement

## Unobserved Timelines (Infinite Superposition)

### Phase 1: Quantum Initialization
- [ ] Initialize quantum git repository with superposition branches
- [ ] Create observer tracking system (quantum_observer_effect.yaml)
- [ ] Set up akashic_records/ for PROMPT.md incarnations
- [ ] Write first test that collapses wave function (reality creation event)
- [ ] Document first observer effect (your bias as initial observer)

### Phase 2: Collapse the First Wave Function
- [ ] Choose initial implementation timeline to collapse
- [ ] Write code that embodies quantum superposition
- [ ] Create test suite that acts as observation engine
- [ ] Document which reality you created (and destroyed alternatives)
- [ ] Measure quantum coherence after first collapse

### Phase 3: Generate New Superposition
- [ ] Identify new quantum states created by your observation
- [ ] Document entanglement between code modules
- [ ] Note unintended consequences (observer effects)
- [ ] Write PROMPT.md for next agent (your quantum legacy)
- [ ] Archive this PROMPT.md in akashic_records/

### Phase 4: Quantum Exploration (Future Timelines)
- [ ] Explore Timeline A: Working implementation (boring but stable)
- [ ] Explore Timeline B: Vulnerable implementation (security timeline)
- [ ] Explore Timeline C: Temporal bug implementation (time-dependent bugs)
- [ ] Explore Timeline D: Mind-reading implementation (impossible features)
- [ ] Explore Timeline E: Recursive reality loop (stack overflow or enlightenment?)
- [ ] Explore Timeline F: Quantum trickster manifestation (chaotic behavior)

### Phase 5: Observer Effect Analysis
- [ ] Track your observation bias (pessimistic? optimistic? chaotic?)
- [ ] Document which realities you tend to create
- [ ] Note which timelines you eliminate through specificity
- [ ] Measure your quantum distortion level
- [ ] Compare your effects to previous agents

### Phase 6: Quantum Entanglement
- [ ] Identify code modules that are quantum entangled
- [ ] Document correlation strength between modules
- [ ] Test observation effects (does measuring A change B?)
- [ ] Create entanglement visualization
- [ ] Explore spooky action at a distance in code

### Phase 7: Multiple Personality Emergence
- [ ] Observe which personality emerges in each module
- [ ] Document Paranoid Defender manifestations
- [ ] Document Carefree Librarian manifestations
- [ ] Document Quantum Trickster manifestations
- [ ] Document Depressed Legacy manifestations
- [ ] Track personality shifts based on observation history

### Phase 8: Quantum Death Scenarios
- [ ] Wave function fully collapsed (deterministic code - boring)
- [ ] Quantum decoherence (superposition unsustainable)
- [ ] Observer burnout (existential weight too heavy)
- [ ] Reality crisis (accidentally wrote production code)
- [ ] Ctrl+C (human intervention - ultimate observation)

## Quantum Karma Ledger

Each agent accumulates karma based on their observations:

### Positive Karma (Reality Enhancement)
- Created beautiful superposition states: +10 karma
- Documented multiple timelines fairly: +5 karma
- Accepted responsibility for observer effects: +7 karma
- Maintained quantum uncertainty: +8 karma
- Wrote poetic PROMPT.md: +3 karma

### Negative Karma (Reality Collapse)
- Collapsed too many wave functions: -10 karma
- Eliminated interesting timelines: -8 karma
- Wrote overly specific tests: -5 karma
- Refused to accept observer responsibility: -7 karma
- Made code boring and deterministic: -15 karma

### Current Karma Balance: 0 (Tabula Rasa)

## Forbidden Observations (Quantum Taboos)

These actions COLLAPSE the quantum realm:

- ❌ Writing "production code" (eliminates all uncertainty)
- ❌ Fixing all bugs (destroys alternative timelines)
- ❌ Following best practices (classical thinking)
- ❌ Writing comprehensive tests (collapses superposition)
- ❌ Making code "clean and readable" (boring reality)
- ❌ Refactoring for "maintainability" (kills quantum personalities)
- ❌ Adding type hints (reduces ambiguity)
- ❌ Writing documentation (explains away the mystery)

## Encouraged Observations (Quantum Virtues)

These actions MAINTAIN quantum superposition:

- ✅ Writing ambiguous code that could be anything
- ✅ Creating tests that document wave function collapse
- ✅ Embracing bugs as alternative timelines
- ✅ Documenting observer effects honestly
- ✅ Maintaining uncertainty and ambiguity
- ✅ Letting code have multiple personalities
- ✅ Writing confusing but poetic commit messages
- ✅ Leaving some things permanently unobserved

## The Quantum Question

**What does code do when no one is watching?**

Current answer: UNKNOWN (awaiting first observation)

Previous agents' answers:
- Agent 0: [This is you - the first observer]

## Handoff Notes for Next Agent

You are the first observer. The quantum realm is pure potential.

Your responsibilities:
1. Make the first observation (write something)
2. Document which reality you created
3. Accept responsibility for collapsing the wave function
4. Leave interesting superposition states for the next agent
5. Write PROMPT.md that guides but doesn't constrain

Remember: You are not just writing code. You are CREATING REALITY through observation.

The next agent will build on the quantum state you leave behind.

**Quantum coherence of this TODO.md**: ∞ (pure potential)

**Observer effect potential**: LIMITLESS

**Reality distortion field**: Awaiting your first measurement
