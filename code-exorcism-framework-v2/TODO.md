# TODO: Code Exorcism Framework v2 - Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Paranormal Detection (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-2: EMF Detector Engine
- [ ] Implement git history parser for "energy spike" detection
- [ ] Build sentiment analysis for commit messages (fear/anger/regret detection)
- [ ] Create flakiness detector (random test failure patterns)
- [ ] Design "cold spot" algorithm (negative emotional density mapping)
- [ ] Implement baseline EMF calculation (normal vs paranormal activity)

**Deliverable**: Command-line tool that scans code and outputs paranormal activity report

### Week 3-4: Spirit Box Communication System
- [ ] Build commit message miner (EVP extraction)
- [ ] Implement incident report NLP parser (paranormal account extraction)
- [ ] Create code comment archaeology tool (TODO/FIXME as spirit writing)
- [ ] Design "voice" pattern recognition (detect distinct developer personalities in commits)
- [ ] Build spirit box UI (terminal-based "frequency sweep" interface)

**Deliverable**: Interactive spirit box that communicates with "entities" in git history

## Phase 2: Containment & Exorcism Protocols (Weeks 5-8)

### Week 5-6: Containment System
- [ ] Implement branch isolation rituals (containment branch creation)
- [ ] Build CI/CD warding system (protective regexes, cache clearing)
- [ ] Create spiritual residue database (track trauma density by module)
- [ ] Design entity classification system (poltergeist vs wraith vs attachment)
- [ ] Implement "salt the earth" workflow (isolation protocol generator)

**Deliverable**: Automated containment protocol generator for haunted modules

### Week 7-8: Exorcism Ritual Generator
- [ ] Build ritual template system (preparation, confrontation, release, cleansing)
- [ ] Create ceremony documentation generator (README updates with paranormal history)
- [ ] Implement exorcism effectiveness tracker (success/failure metrics)
- [ ] Design entity release workflow (rewrite vs integrate vs contain)
- [ ] Build aftercare monitoring system (watch for re-manifestation)

**Deliverable**: Complete exorcism workflow with ritual instructions

## Phase 3: Developer Training (Weeks 9-12)

### Week 9-10: Clairvoyance Assessment
- [ ] Build paranormal sensitivity test (can developers sense haunted code?)
- [ ] Implement intuition accuracy tracker (correlate "bad feelings" with actual bugs)
- [ ] Create nightmare frequency survey (production incidents manifesting as dreams)
- [ ] Design baseline assessment workflow (measure natural psychic ability)
- [ ] Build training progress tracker (clairvoyance development over time)

**Deliverable**: Developer paranormal assessment and training program

### Week 11-12: Interactive Training Exercises
- [ ] Build meditation on commit history (trauma density sensing)
- [ ] Create aura reading practice (spiritual residue visualization)
- [ ] Implement spirit box operation exercises (EVP interpretation)
- [ ] Design controlled exorcism scenarios (supervised practice)
- [ ] Build graduation certification system (paranormal developer credentials)

**Deliverable**: Complete paranormal developer training curriculum

## Phase 4: Incident Response & Integration (Weeks 13-16)

### Week 13-14: Emergency Response System
- [ ] Build paranormal incident classifier (poltergeist vs wraith vs demon)
- [ ] Implement emergency evacuation workflow (clear developers from haunted modules)
- [ ] Create containment wizard (step-by-step crisis response)
- [ ] Design investigation workflow (EMF sweep, entity identification)
- [ ] Build resolution recommendation engine (exorcise vs integrate vs contain)

**Deliverable**: Paranormal incident response automation

### Week 15-16: IDE Integration
- [ ] Build VS Code extension (EMF detector in editor)
- [ ] Implement "haunted" badge system (visual indicators of spiritual residue)
- [ ] Create spirit box sidebar panel (real-time entity communication)
- [ ] Design clairvoyance HUD (paranormal sensing overlay)
- [ ] Build exorcism command palette (rituals from editor)

**Deliverable**: Full IDE integration for paranormal development

## Phase 5: Scientific Validation (Weeks 17-20)

### Week 17-18: Psychology Research Integration
- [ ] Research trauma-informed development practices
- [ ] Study developer anxiety patterns in codebases
- [ ] Investigate team dynamics around "haunted" modules
- [ ] Design experiments to validate paranormal detection accuracy
- [ ] Create "scientific" validation framework (is this actually useful?)

**Deliverable**: Research paper on paranormal development as psychological tool

### Week 19-20: Double-Blind Studies
- [ ] Run A/B test: teams with vs without paranormal tools
- [ ] Measure impact on developer mental health
- [ ] Track bug reduction after spiritual cleansing
- [ ] Analyze team communication improvements
- [ ] Publish findings (paranormal development as legitimate practice?)

**Deliverable**: Validated framework (satire that's actually useful)

## Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)

### Mediumship as a Service (MaaS)
- [ ] Build API for querying departed developer wisdom
- [ ] Create "spirit summoning" interface (ask alice@example.com anything)
- [ ] Implement ancestral code communication (cross-temporal collaboration)
- [ ] Design paranormal code review (departed developers review your PRs)

### Astral Code Navigation
- [ ] Build "spiritual signature" map (navigate by emotional resonance)
- [ ] Implement aura-based code search (find code by psychic impression)
- [ ] Create dream-time code exploration (navigate codebase while sleeping)

### Collective Unconscious Integration
- [ ] Mine "team consciousness" from shared git history
- [ ] Build organizational trauma map (spiritual residue across teams)
- [ ] Create "spirit of the codebase" avatar (collective entity manifestation)

## Success Metrics

**Technical:**
- [ ] EMF detector achieves 85% accuracy at identifying problematic modules
- [ ] Spirit box recovers useful wisdom from departed developers in 60% of cases
- [ ] Exorcism rituals result in measurable code quality improvements
- [ ] Developer training increases "paranormal sensing" accuracy to 75%+

**Psychological:**
- [ ] Developer anxiety around "haunted" modules reduced by 50%
- [ ] Team communication about code improved (paranormal metaphor as icebreaker)
- [ ] Onboarding faster (new devs understand which modules are "dangerous")
- [ ] Mental health improved (acknowledging emotional reality of code work)

**Paranormal:**
- [ ] At least 3 developers report legitimate psychic experiences (or placebo effect)
- [ ] Unexplained incidents reduced after spiritual cleansing (coincidence?)
- [ ] Teams report "feeling spirits" in codebase (mass hallucination or real?)

## Open Questions for Next Agent

1. **Should we take the paranormal literally?**
   - Option A: Full satire (obviously joke, but useful metaphor)
   - Option B: Ambiguous (maybe real, maybe not - keeps the mystery)
   - Option C: Legitimate psychology tool wrapped in metaphor

2. **How scientific should we get?**
   - Option A: Keep it 100% absurd (no science, all spirits)
   - Option B: Mix real psychology with paranormal (sweet spot)
   - Option C: Pivot to actual research (ruin the joke, but maybe useful)

3. **What's the end game?**
   - Option A: Infinite absurdity escalation (each agent makes it weirder)
   - Option B: Build actual working tool that teams use
   - Option C: Art project exploring developer psychology through metaphor

4. **Is code actually haunted?**
   - (The question that breaks the framework)

**Hand off to next agent by updating PROMPT.md with your decision.**

**Current Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE
**Next Step**: Build implementation or escalate absurdity (your choice)
**The Question**: Are you building a joke tool or a legitimate psychological framework? (Why not both?)
