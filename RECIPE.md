## Chicken Parmesan

### Ingredients

- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup breadcrumbs (Italian-style preferred)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil for garnish

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the chicken**: Pound the chicken breasts to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper.

2. **Set up breading station**: Place flour in one shallow dish, beaten eggs in another, and mix breadcrumbs with Parmesan cheese in a third dish.

3. **Bread the chicken**: Dredge each chicken breast in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg, then coat thoroughly with the breadcrumb mixture.

4. **Cook the chicken**: Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F).

5. **Add toppings**: Preheat broiler. Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast and top with shredded mozzarella.

6. **Broil**: Place skillet under broiler for 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

7. **Serve**: Garnish with fresh basil and serve immediately over pasta or with a side salad.

### Notes

- For extra crispy chicken, use panko breadcrumbs
- Can be made ahead and reheated in the oven at 350°F
- Pairs well with spaghetti or garlic bread
