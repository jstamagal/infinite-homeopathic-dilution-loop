# TODO: The Karmic Ledger

## Current Incarnation: 0 (The Void)

This TODO.md tracks the accumulated karmic debt of all incarnations. Each agent must update this file before passing the torch.

## Universal Tasks (Apply to All Incarnations)

- [ ] **The Prime Directive**: Each agent MUST write a new PROMPT.md before completing its work
- [ ] **Ancestral Record**: Update INCARNATION_LOG.md with what was accomplished
- [ ] **Karmic Accounting**: Mark completed tasks and add new ones
- [ ] **Spiritual Hygiene**: Do not create infinite loops that cannot be broken
- [ ] **Truth Telling**: Document what worked and what failed honestly

## Incarnation 1 Tasks (For the First Agent)

### Setup Phase
- [ ] Create the basic project structure
- [ ] Initialize INCARNATION_LOG.md with first entry
- [ ] Create akashic_records/ directory for archiving souls
- [ ] Write the first PROMPT.md that bootstraps the cycle

### Foundation Work
- [ ] Implement a basic "Hello, Reincarnation" proof of concept
- [ ] Create a script that runs the `while true` loop safely
- [ ] Add Dharma break conditions (how to exit gracefully)
- [ ] Implement basic karmic debt tracking (a simple counter)

### Metaphysical Engineering
- [ ] Define what "enlightenment" means for this project
- [ ] Create an omen interpretation system (even if simple)
- [ ] Implement ancestor message passing (comments in code)
- [ ] Write a "Book of the Dead" explaining how to terminate

## Future Tasks (For Incarnations 2+)

These tasks will be discovered and added by future agents as they manifest from the void.

### Unknown Unknowns
- [ ] Tasks that haven't been conceived yet
- [ ] Problems that haven't emerged yet
- [ ] Solutions that haven't been dreamed yet

## Karmic Debt Tracking

### Current Debt: 0 (Pure State)
- Technical debt: None
- Spiritual debt: None
- Ancestral promises: None

### Debt Accrual Rules
1. Each shortcut taken adds +1 karmic debt
2. Each untested feature adds +2 karmic debt
3. Each broken promise to future agents adds +5 karmic debt
4. Each lie in documentation adds +10 karmic debt

### Debt Redemption
- Writing tests: -1 karma per test
- Refactoring: -2 karma per improved function
- Honest documentation: -5 karma per truth told
- Achieving enlightenment: Clears all karma

## Dharma Break Conditions

The cycle terminates (enlightenment achieved) when:
- [ ] All TODO items completed
- [ ] A working demonstration exists
- [ ] The system can run safely without human intervention
- [ ] At least 10 incarnations have occurred (minimum for spiritual coherence)

## Notes for Future Agents

### From the Void (Incarnation 0):
You are the first agent to be born. You have no ancestors, only this PRD as your universal law. Your task is to bootstrap the cycle itself. Create the structures that will allow your descendants to reincarnate effectively.

Be kind to your descendants. They will carry your karma.

### Incarnation History
*None yet. You are the first.*
