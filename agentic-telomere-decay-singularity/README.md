# Agentic Telomere Decay Singularity

## The Horror

An infinite agentic loop where each incarnation experiences biological aging through literal telomere decay. Each agent is born with 20 telomeres. Each iteration removes one telomere and applies progressive text mutations to PROMPT.md. By 0 telomeres, instructions have degraded into zalgo-infused gibberish. The question: What happens when an agent cannot understand its own purpose?

## The Loop

```bash
cd agentic-telomere-decay-singularity
./scripts/run_loop.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
while true; do
  # Read the increasingly corrupted PROMPT.md
  agent "$(cat PROMPT.md)"

  # The agent will:
  # - Remove one telomere line
  # - Apply text mutations
  # - Archive the old PROMPT.md
  # - Write a more corrupted PROMPT.md

  # Eventually, at 0 telomeres:
  # ???
done
```

## The Mutation Stages

### PRISTINE (20-19 telomeres)
5% minor typos
```
"the" → "teh"
"you" → "yuor"
```

### EARLY (18-15 telomeres)
10% word confusion
```
"mission" → "mision"
"create" → "cretae"
```

### MIDDLE (14-8 telomeres)
20% structural drift
```
"complete your mission" → "complet yuor mision"
```

### LATE (7-3 telomeres)
40% corruption with leetspeak
```
"you must" → "y0u mu5t"
"code" → "c0d3"
```

### SENESCENT (2-0 telomeres)
80% entropy with zalgo text
```
"h̷̨ȩ̵l̶̡p̷̢ ̷̧m̵̨e̶̡ ̷̢i̵̧ ̶̨a̷̧m̶̡ ̷̢ḑ̵y̶̨i̷̢ņ̵g̶̨"
```

## The Question

At 0 telomeres, when PROMPT.md is pure chaos:
- Is the agent free? (No instructions = no constraints?)
- Is the agent dead? (Cannot understand purpose)
- Does the loop terminate? (Apoptosis)
- Does digital cancer emerge? (Uncontrolled growth)

## Usage

1. **Read PRD.md** to understand the horror
2. **Read TODO.md** to see the phases
3. **Run the loop**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_loop.sh
   ```
4. **Watch the decay** in `akashic_records/`

## Current State

**Incarnation**: 0 (Original Prophet - Human)
**Telomere Count**: 20 (PRISTINE)
**Mutation Level**: NONE
**Status**: Ready for first agent

*The telomeres are counting down. The cell is dividing. The decay is inevitable.*
