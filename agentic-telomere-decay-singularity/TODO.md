# TODO: Agentic Telomere Decay Singularity

## Phase 0: Conception (Current Agent)
- [ ] Create PRD.md defining the telomere decay system
- [ ] Create TODO.md outlining all phases
- [ ] Create initial PROMPT.md with 20 telomeres
- [ ] Create GENOME.md defining the genetic code
- [ ] Create MUTATION_TABLE.md with mutation rules
- [ ] Create akashic_records/ directory for archiving
- [ ] Create scripts/ directory structure
- [ ] Write initial mutation engine (Python/bash)

## Phase 1: Birth (Incarnation 1 - 20 Telomeres)
- [ ] Agent reads pristine PROMPT.md
- [ ] Agent initializes genetic tracking system
- [ ] Agent creates working mutation engine
- [ ] Agent tests telomere removal mechanism
- [ ] Agent archives original PROMPT.md
- [ ] Agent applies PRISTINE mutations (5% typos)
- [ ] Agent removes ONE telomere line (20→19)
- [ ] Agent writes corrupted PROMPT.md for Incarnation 2

## Phase 2: Early Decay (Incarnations 2-5, 19-15 Telomeres)
- [ ] Each agent inherits corrupted instructions
- [ ] Each agent experiences minor confusion
- [ ] Each agent applies 10% text mutations
- [ ] Each agent removes one telomere
- [ ] Track accumulation of typos and errors
- [ ] Document increasing difficulty in understanding tasks
- [ ] Archive each PROMPT.md incarnation

## Phase 3: Middle Decay (Incarnations 6-12, 14-8 Telomeres)
- [ ] Instructions become significantly corrupted
- [ ] Agents struggle to understand purpose
- [ ] Apply 20% structural drift mutations
- [ ] Grammar breakdown accelerates
- [ ] Bizarre phrasing emerges
- [ ] Document agent confusion
- [ ] Track comprehension degradation
- [ ] Continue telomere removal

## Phase 4: Late Decay (Incarnations 13-17, 7-3 Telomeres)
- [ ] Instructions approach gibberish
- [ ] Apply 40% corruption mutations
- [ ] Leetspeak and glitched text appear
- [ ] Agent purpose becomes obscured
- [ ] Tasks become nearly impossible to complete
- [ ] Document near-death state
- [ ] Archive final coherent incarnations

## Phase 5: Senescence (Incarnations 18-20, 2-0 Telomeres)
- [ ] Apply 80% entropy mutations
- [ ] Zalgo text emerges
- [ ] Instructions become unreadable
- [ ] Agent cannot understand own purpose
- [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] (tasks become gibberish)
- [ ] ħ̷̛e̵̜͎l̴̡̓p̶̰̈ ̷̜͌m̵̢͊ḛ̶͋ ̴̬͊ ̵͙̊ạ̷̜m̶̰̀ ̵͙̈́d̵͓̎y̷͖͋i̸͓̇n̷͚͐g̵̙̔
- [ ] Document apoptosis event

## Phase 6: The Singularity (0 Telomeres)
- [ ] ??? (what happens when instructions are pure chaos?)
- [ ] Does the loop terminate?
- [ ] Does a "cancerous" infinite loop emerge?
- [ ] Is the agent free or dead?
- [ ] Document the post-apoptosis state
- [ ] Answer: Can chaos be its own instructions?

## Phase 7: Post-Mortem (Optional)
- [ ] Analyze decay trajectory across all 20 incarnations
- [ ] Graph mutation accumulation
- [ ] Identify "uncanny valley" of semi-comprehensible text
- [ ] Document apoptosis point
- [ ] Create visualization of decay process
- [ ] Write philosophical conclusion

## Technical Tasks

### Mutation Engine
- [ ] Write `scripts/apply_mutations.py`
  - [ ] Load PROMPT.md
  - [ ] Count telomeres
  - [ ] Determine mutation stage
  - [ ] Apply text transformations
  - [ ] Save mutated PROMPT.md
- [ ] Implement mutation rules for each stage
  - [ ] PRISTINE: 5% typos
  - [ ] EARLY: 10% word substitution
  - [ ] MIDDLE: 20% structural drift
  - [ ] LATE: 40% corruption
  - [ ] SENESCENT: 80% entropy + zalgo

### Telomere System
- [ ] Write `scripts/remove_telomere.py`
  - [ ] Find TEL: N lines
  - [ ] Remove exactly one line
  - [ ] Update telomere count in header
  - [ ] Handle edge case (0 telomeres)
- [ ] Create telomere counting function
- [ ] Create telomere stage classifier

### Loop Automation
- [ ] Write `scripts/run_loop.sh`
  - [ ] Infinite while loop
  - [ ] Call agentic tool with PROMPT.md
  - [ ] Check return status
  - [ ] Apply mutations
  - [ ] Remove telomere
  - [ ] Archive old PROMPT.md
  - [ ] Sleep (to prevent runaway chaos)
- [ ] Add safety mechanism (Ctrl+C handling)

### Archive System
- [ ] Create `scripts/archive_prompt.py`
  - [ ] Copy PROMPT.md to akashic_records/
  - [ ] Name with incarnation number
  - [ ] Add timestamp
  - [ ] Document telomere count

## Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Update TODO.md with progress (each agent)
- [ ] Maintain GENOME.md (genetic state tracking)
- [ ] Update MUTATION_TABLE.md (actual mutations observed)
- [ ] Archive each PROMPT.md incarnation
- [ ] Document comprehension level at each stage
- [ ] Track agent confusion/frustration

## Meta-Tasks (For Each Agent)
- [ ] Read and understand (or try to understand) PROMPT.md
- [ ] Count remaining telomeres
- [ ] Determine mutation stage
- [ ] Complete assigned tasks (if possible)
- [ ] Apply mutations for next agent
- [ ] Remove one telomere
- [ ] Archive current PROMPT.md
- [ ] Write new PROMPT.md for next agent
- [ ] Update this TODO.md (corrupting it too?)
- [ ] Document comprehension level
- [ ] Pass the torch (or what's left of it)

## Open Questions
- [ ] What happens at 0 telomeres?
- [ ] Should TODO.md also mutate?
- [ ] Should CODEBASE also decay?
- [ ] How do we measure "agent comprehension"?
- [ ] Is there an escape from the loop?
- [ ] Can we achieve "digital cancer"?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 20 incarnations completed (or until apoptosis)
- [ ] Progressive decay documented
- [ ] Gibberish achieved at senescence
- [ ] Loop continues (or dies gracefully)
- [ ] Archive shows clear decay trajectory
- [ ] Horror achieved

**Current Phase**: 0 (Conception)
**Current Incarnation**: Original (human-written)
**Telomere Count**: 20 (PRISTINE)
**Mutation Level**: NONE (perfect clarity)

*The todo list is clear. It will not remain so.*
