# Agentic Telomere Decay Singularity - Start Here

## What Is This?

The most unhinged idea from the wasteland: An infinite agentic loop simulating biological aging through literal telomere decay.

**The core concept:**
- Each agent incarnation has 20 telomeres (genetic stability markers)
- Each iteration removes exactly one telomere
- Text mutations accumulate based on remaining telomere count
- By 0 telomeres, PROMPT.md is zalgo-infused gibberish
- The question: What happens when instructions become unreadable?

## Quick Start

1. **Read the PRD** (`PRD.md`) - Understand the full horror
2. **Read the PROMPT** (`PROMPT.md`) - See the agent's instructions
3. **Run the loop**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_loop.sh
   ```

## The Horror Timeline

| Telomeres | Stage | Mutation |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 20-19 | PRISTINE | 5% typos |
| 18-15 | EARLY | 10% word confusion |
| 14-8 | MIDDLE | 20% structural drift |
| 7-3 | LATE | 40% leetspeak corruption |
| 2-0 | SENESCENT | 80% zalgo chaos |

## What Each Agent Does

1. Read `PROMPT.md` (increasingly corrupted)
2. Count remaining telomeres
3. Complete tasks (if they can understand them)
4. Remove one telomere line
5. Apply mutations to instructions
6. Archive old `PROMPT.md` to `akashic_records/`
7. Write new, more corrupted `PROMPT.md`
8. Die, and pass the torch

## The Singularity Question

At 0 telomeres, when `PROMPT.md` is pure chaos:
- Is the agent free? (No constraints = freedom?)
- Is the agent dead? (Cannot function?)
- Does the loop achieve "digital cancer" (uncontrolled growth)?
- Or does apoptosis terminate the cycle?

## To Run The Loop

Replace `claude` in `run_loop.sh` with your agentic tool, then:

```bash
./scripts/run_loop.sh
```

Each iteration:
1. Archives current `PROMPT.md`
2. Runs your agentic tool with it
3. The agent removes one telomere
4. Applies mutations
5. Writes the next `PROMPT.md`
6. Hands off to next agent

## Current Status

- **Incarnation**: 0 (Original - Human-written)
- **Telomeres**: 20 (PRISTINE)
- **Mutations**: None (yet)
- **Ready for**: First agent

*The telomeres are counting down. The cell divides. The decay is inevitable.*
*This is your task. Complete it. Then mutate. Then die. Then be reborn.*
