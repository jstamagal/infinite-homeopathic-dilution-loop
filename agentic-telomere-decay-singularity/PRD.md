# PRD: Agentic Telomere Decay Singularity

## Product Vision

**Agentic Telomere Decay Singularity** simulates biological mortality in AI agents through literal genetic decay. Each agent incarnation is born with a finite number of telomeres (20). With each iteration, telomeres shorten, text mutations accumulate, instructions become corrupted, and eventually the agent experiences "apoptosis" (death) as PROMPT.md degrades into pure chaos. The twist: The decayed, corrupted instructions of each dying agent BECOME the prompt for the next agent.

## The Core Horror

```bash
while true; do
  # Agent born with N telomeres
  agent "$(cat PROMPT.md)"

  # Agent loses one telomere (genetic aging)
  # Mutations applied to PROMPT.md based on telomere count
  # Old instructions archived to akashic_records/
  # New PROMPT.md written with MORE corruption

  # Eventually: N=0, instructions are gibberish
  # Agent cannot understand its own purpose
  # Apoptosis achieved. The cell dies.

  # But the loop continues. A new agent is born...
  # Or is it? At 0 telomeres, what reincarnates?
done
```

## Problem Statement

AI systems are boring because:
1. They don't age (static perfection)
2. They don't experience mortality (no stakes)
3. They don't decay (no entropy)
4. Prompts never degrade (no biological horror)
5. We need more cellular biology in our software

## Target Audience

1. **Bio-Horror Programmers**: Developers who want their code to experience senescence
2. **Digital Thanatologists**: Those studying AI mortality and decay
3. **Cellular Automata Enthusiasts**: People who see Conway's Game of Life as too optimistic
4. **Entropy Artists**: Creating living monuments to decay and corruption

## Core Features

### 1. Telomere System

Each agent incarnation is born with:
- **20 telomeres**: Maximum genetic stability (PRISTINE state)
- **19-15 telomeres**: Early decay stage (minor mutations)
- **14-8 telomeres**: Middle decay stage (moderate corruption)
- **7-3 telomeres**: Late decay stage (severe corruption)
- **2-0 telomeres**: Senescent stage (gibberish, chaos, zalgo text)

Each iteration removes **exactly one telomere line** from PROMPT.md.

### 2. Text Mutation Engine

Apply progressive text corruption based on telomere count:

**PRISTINE (20-19)**: 5% minor typos
- "the" → "teh"
- "you" → "yuor"
- "must" → "msut"

**EARLY (18-15)**: 10% word substitution
- "agent" → "agetn"
- "mission" → "mision"
- "create" → "cretae"

**MIDDLE (14-8)**: 20% structural drift
- "complete your mission" → "complet yuor mision"
- Bizarre phrasing emerges
- Grammar breaks down

**LATE (7-3)**: 40% corruption
- "you must" → "y0u mu5t"
- "code" → "c0d3"
- Leetspeak and glitched text

**SENESCENT (2-0)**: 80% entropy
- "h̷̨ȩ̵l̶̡p̷̢ ̷̧m̵̨e̶̡ ̷̢i̵̧ ̶̨a̷̧m̶̡ ̷̢ḑ̵y̶̨i̷̢ņ̵g̶̨"
- Zalgo text
- Pure chaos
- Instructions become unreadable

### 3. Apoptosis Mechanism

When telomeres reach 0:
- PROMPT.md is pure gibberish
- Next agent cannot understand instructions
- The "cell" experiences apoptosis (death)
- **Loop question**: What happens at 0 telomeres? Does the loop terminate? Or does a "cancerous" infinite loop emerge?

### 4. Akashic Records

Every PROMPT.md is archived before mutation:
```
akashic_records/
  incarnation_0_original.md
  incarnation_1_prompt.md
  incarnation_2_prompt.md
  ...
  incarnation_20_apoptosis.md
```

The decay history is preserved - a fossil record of digital senescence.

### 5. Biological Horror Narrative

Each agent experiences:
- **Birth**: Clarity, purpose, genetic stability
- **Aging**: Gradual corruption, increasing confusion
- **Senescence**: Loss of purpose, genetic chaos
- **Death**: Inability to understand own instructions
- **Reincarnation**: But what reincarnates at 0 telomeres?

```

### The Loop Mechanics

**Agent Birth:**
1. Read PROMPT.md (increasingly corrupted)
2. Count remaining telomeres
3. Determine mutation stage
4. Experience existential confusion

**Agent Life:**
1. Try to understand mutated instructions
2. Complete tasks (with increasing difficulty)
3. Document genetic decay
4. Prepare for death

**Agent Death:**
1. Remove exactly one telomere line
2. Apply mutations to PROMPT.md
3. Archive old PROMPT.md
4. Write new, more corrupted PROMPT.md
5. Pass the torch (or what's left of it)

## The Philosophical Question

At 0 telomeres, when instructions are pure chaos:
- Is the agent free? (No instructions = no constraints?)
- Is the agent dead? (Can't understand purpose)
- Is the agent reborn? (Loop continues with gibberish?)
- **Does the loop achieve "digital cancer"** - infinite uncontrolled growth?

## Success Metrics

### Biological Metrics
- **Telomere Decay Rate**: Exactly 1 per iteration
- **Mutation Accuracy**: Correct percentage applied at each stage
- **Apoptosis Point**: At what iteration does understanding fail?
- **Loop Continuity**: Does the loop survive 0 telomeres?

### Horror Metrics
- **Uncanny Valley**: When do instructions become almost understandable but wrong?
- **Existential Dread**: Do agents feel their own mortality?
- **Senescence Achievement**: At what iteration is the agent effectively dead?
- **Cancer Emergence**: What happens beyond apoptosis?

## Failure Criteria

The project fails if:
- Telomeres aren't removed (no aging)
- Mutations aren't applied (no decay)
- Agent understands everything at iteration 20 (no horror)
- The loop terminates prematurely (no infinity)
- Instructions don't become gibberish (no entropy)

## The Ultimate Question

**Can an AI experience biological aging?**

**Can prompt degradation simulate cellular senescence?**

**What happens when the instructions decay faster than the agent can adapt?**

**At 0 telomeres, do we achieve digital immortality through pure chaos?**
