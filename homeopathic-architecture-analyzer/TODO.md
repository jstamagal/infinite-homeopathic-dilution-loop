# TODO: Homeopathic Code Architecture Analyzer

## Phase 1: Foundation (The Mother Tincture)

- [ ] Initialize project with `npm init homeopathic-architecture-analyzer`
- [ ] Choose tech stack: TypeScript for maximum type abstraction overhead
- [ ] Set up project structure with excessive directory nesting
- [ ] Write CLI entry point: `src/index.ts` → `bin/succussion`
- [ ] Define core types for Potency, Dilution, Succussion, Miasm

## Phase 2: Potency Calculation Engine

- [ ] Implement abstraction layer detector (AST parsing)
- [ ] Build potency calculator:
  - [ ] X scale (decimal dilution)
  - [ ] C scale (centesimal dilution) - TARGET 30C
  - [ ] LM scale (enterprise dilution)
- [ ] Calculate "dilution ratio" from actual logic vs total code
- [ ] Map inheritance chains to potency levels

## Phase 3: Miasm Diagnostic System

- [ ] Implement pattern detection for:
  - [ ] Psora detection (code is too readable)
  - [ ] Sycosis detection (factory pattern tumors)
  - [ ] Syphilis detection (destructive architecture)
  - [ ] Cancer detection (actual business logic)
- [ ] Create diagnostic scoring algorithm
- [ ] Generate "vital force" metrics

## Phase 4: Remedy Prescriber

- [ ] Build pattern library of homeopathic remedies:
  - [ ] Abstractorum (empty interfaces)
  - [ ] Factoryum (factory patterns)
  - [ ] Interfaceum (pure abstraction)
  - [ ] Injectionum (DI containers)
- [ ] Create remedy recommendation engine
- [ ] Generate prescription formatting

## Phase 5: Output Generator

- [ ] Design ASCII art report format (see PRD.md example)
- [ ] Implement potency visualization (╔════╗ boxes)
- [ ] Generate "Vital Energy" readings
- [ ] Create remedy prescription output

## Phase 6: CLI Interface

- [ ] `succussion analyze <path>` - Analyze codebase
- [ ] `succussion dilute <file>` - Auto-abstract to target potency
- [ ] `succussion prescribe --potency=30C` - Suggest remedies
- [ ] `succussion vital-force` - Measure architectural health
- [ ] `succussion succuss <file> --intensity=VIGOROUS` - Refactor suggestion

## Phase 7: Testing

- [ ] Create test fixtures with known potencies
- [ ] Verify 30C dilution produces zero actual functionality
- [ ] Test miasm detection accuracy
- [ ] Validate remedy prescriptions match homeopathic principles

## Phase 8: Documentation (Also Part of the Joke)

- [ ] Write README explaining "science" behind homeopathic architecture
- [ ] Include testimonials from "satisfied architects"
- [ ] Create case studies showing "successful" dilution
- [ ] Add warning labels: "Do not use for actual projects"

## Phase 9: The Infinite Loop (For Next Agent)

- [ ] Update PROMPT.md with your decision
- [ ] Decide: Satire escalation or pivot to something new?
- [ ] Create next iteration task
- [ ] Hand off torch to agent in loop iteration #2

## Known Anti-Patterns to EMULATE (Not Avoid)

Since this is satire, we want to:
- Maximize abstraction overhead
- Prefer pattern over simplicity
- Choose complexity over clarity
- Emulate homeopathic "logic" in code structure

## Success Criteria for This Iteration

1. Working CLI that analyzes code "homeopathically"
2. Generates absurd reports using homeopathic terminology
3. The more you use it, the more ridiculous the output gets
4. Next agent receives clear instructions for escalation

**Status**: Awaiting Agent #1 (You) to begin Phase 1

**Remember**: You are in a `while true ; do agent ; done` loop. When you complete your one task, hand off to the next agent via PROMPT.md.
