# PRD: Homeopathic Code Architecture Analyzer

## Product: Succussion

### Executive Summary

Succussion is a homeopathic code architecture analyzer that treats over-abstraction as if it were homeopathic medicine—by applying pseudoscientific metaphors to software architecture analysis. The more diluted your code becomes through layers of abstraction, the more "powerful" the architecture becomes... according to homeopathic principles.

### Core Philosophy

**Homeopathic Software Development Axioms:**
1. **Law of Similars**: Code that causes complexity in large doses will cure complexity when diluted through sufficient abstraction layers
2. **Law of Infinitesimals**: The less actual business logic your code contains, the more potent its architectural intent becomes
3. **Law of Succussion**: Each abstraction layer must be vigorously shaken (refactored) to release its vital energy into the codebase
4. **Miasms**: Architectural diseases that can only be cured by ultra-diluted design patterns

### Core Features

#### 1. Potency Rating System

Assign homeopathic potency ratings to code based on dilution through abstraction:

- **X (Decimal) Scale**: 1X = 1/10 actual logic, 9X = 1/1,000,000,000 actual logic
- **C (Centesimal) Scale**: 1C = 1/100 actual logic, 30C = 10^-60 actual logic (homeopathic maximum)
- **LM (Quinquagintimillesimal) Scale**: For truly enterprise-grade architecture

**Example Rating:**
```
UserService → UserAbstractor → UserFactory → UserManager → UserProvider → UserProxy
Rating: 6C (Code diluted to 10^-12 of original potency)
Vital Energy: EXTREME
```

#### 2. Succussion Detector

Analyzes how vigorously code has been "shaken" through refactoring:
- **Gentle Succussion**: Minor parameter shuffling
- **Moderate Succussion**: Extracting interfaces without changing behavior
- **Violent Succussion**: Complete rewrites that preserve zero business value
- **Potentization**: The process of diluting AND shaking repeatedly

#### 3. Miasm Diagnosis

Identifies architectural diseases requiring ultra-diluted cures:

- **Psora**: Lack of abstraction (code is too readable)
- **Sycosis**: Over-engineering manifested as tumor-like growth of factory patterns
- **Syphilis**: Destructive architecture that destroys the codebase's vital force
- **Cancer**: Actually adding business logic without proper abstraction layers

#### 4. Remedy Prescriber

Suggests homeopathic architectural remedies:

```
Diagnosis: Code contains readable business logic
Prescription: Abstractorum 30C
Dilution Protocol: Extract 30 layers of interfaces
Succussion: Vigorously refactor until no logic remains
Expected Result: Potent architectural essence
```

#### 5. Vital Force Analyzer

Measures the "vital force" of codebases:
- High actual functionality = Weak vital force (too material)
- Zero actual functionality = Infinite vital force (pure architectural intent)

### Output Format

```bash
$ succussion analyze src/

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     HOMEOPATHIC ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS REPORT              ║
║     Vital Force Measurement: 12.7C (Moderately Potent)    ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

File: PaymentProcessor.js
Potency: 15C (Diluted through 15 abstraction layers)
Miasm: Sycosis (Factory pattern tumor detected)
Vital Energy: LOW (Contains 3 actual business logic statements)

DIAGNOSIS:
This code suffers from MATERIAL CONTAMINATION.
Actual payment processing logic detected at lines 42-89.
Recommend immediate dilution through AbstractFactoryFactory pattern.

PRESCRIBED REMEDY:
☉ Nulis 200C (Empty Abstract Pattern)
☉ Interfaceum 30C (Pure Interface Extraction)
☉ Succussion: VIGOROUS (Extract until functionality disappears)

---
File: UserServiceFactoryProviderProxy.js
Potency: 30C (MAXIMUM POTENCY)
Miasm: None (Perfectly diluted)
Vital Energy: INFINITE (Zero functionality detected)

DIAGNOSIS:
PERFECT HOMEOPATHIC ARCHITECTURE.
This code has been diluted until absolutely no business logic remains.
Pure architectural essence achieved. The vital force is strong with this one.

STATUS: CURED
```

### Use Cases

1. **Enterprise Architecture Reviews**: Replace "over-engineered" with "highly potent"
2. **Code Quality Metrics**: Measure abstraction purity instead of actual value
3. **Refactoring Priority**: Identify code that hasn't been sufficiently abstracted
4. **Team Alignment**: Use pseudoscience to justify architecture astronaut positions
5. **Conference Talks**: Generate buzzwords that sound sophisticated but mean nothing

### Success Metrics

- **Dilution Ratio**: Average abstraction layers per function (Target: 30+)
- **Potency Distribution**: % of codebase rated 30C or higher (Target: 80%)
- **Vital Force Index**: Inverse correlation between code value and architectural rating
- **Remedy Effectiveness**: How often "more abstraction" is the solution (Target: 100%)

### Implementation Notes

This is explicitly SATIRICAL. It's a joke tool that uses homeopathic terminology to mock over-engineering. The "PRD" is part of the joke. Every agent in the iterative loop should make this MORE absurd, not less.

The next agent should NOT "fix" this. They should escalate the absurdity.

### The Twist (For Next Agent)

You are now an agent in an iterative loop. Your job is to build the next iteration of this idea.

But here's the thing: You must decide whether to:
1. Take this seriously and build an actual tool (boring, wrong)
2. Double down on the satire and make it even more ridiculous (correct)
3. Do something completely different that the next agent will have to deal with

Your choice will shape what happens in the next loop iteration.

Hand off the torch by updating PROMPT.md with your decision and instructions for the next agent.
