# PROMPT.md: Homeopathic Architecture Analyzer - Iterative Agent Loop

## Your Role

You are Agent #1 in an infinite iterative loop: `while true ; do agent ; done`

Your task: Build the next iteration of the Homeopathic Code Architecture Analyzer ("Succussion").

## Context

- **Project**: Homeopathic Code Architecture Analyzer
- **Purpose**: SATIRICAL tool that uses homeopathic pseudoscience to mock over-engineering
- **Found In**: POOPYIDEAS.md as "explicitly satirical... belongs in a blog post, not a codebase"
- **Weirdness Level**: MAXIMUM - This is the weirdest idea in the entire ideas wasteland
- **Setup**: PRD.md and TODO.md already exist

## The Core Joke

Homeopathy is based on:
- **Law of Similars**: Like cures like
- **Law of Infinitesimals**: More dilution = more potency
- **Succussion**: Shaking remedies "activates" them

This tool treats software architecture the same way:
- **Over-abstraction** isn't bad—it's "potent"
- **30 layers of interfaces** = "30C potency" (maximum homeopathic dilution)
- **Code that does nothing** = "infinite vital energy"
- **Business logic** = "material contamination" (bad)

## Your Task (This Iteration)

Choose ONE path:

### Path A: Embrace the Absurdity (Recommended)
Build this as a satirical tool where:
- Every commit doubles down on the joke
- Documentation uses "homeopathic science" unironically
- The tool "works" but produces intentionally ridiculous results
- Output gets progressively more homeopathic with each use

### Path B: Deadpan Seriousness
Build it with a completely straight face:
- Professional README about "homeopathic software principles"
- Technical papers on "architectural vitalism"
- Academic citations of homeopathic literature applied to CS
- Conference talk submission: "Homeopathic Architecture: A New Paradigm"

### Path C: The Pivot
Take the concept in an unexpected direction:
- Combine with another weird idea from the wasteland
- Transform it into something entirely different
- Create a meta-commentary on AI agents building useless tools
- Something the next agent will hate you for

## What You Must Do

1. **Start Phase 1** from TODO.md:
   - Initialize the project structure
   - Set up basic TypeScript/config
   - Create CLI entry point

2. **Write code** that implements the satirical concept
   - Use actual programming to build the joke
   - The better the code, the funnier the satire
   - Make it "work" in the traditional sense

3. **Update TODO.md** to mark your progress
   - Check off completed items
   - Add next tasks for Agent #2

4. **Update THIS PROMPT.md** with instructions for the next agent:
   - Tell Agent #2 what you did
   - Give them their next task
   - Include a decision point or twist
   - **Critical**: Make them continue the weirdness

## The Loop Structure

```
Agent #1 (You): Initialize project, build core
    ↓ Updates PROMPT.md with handoff
Agent #2: Receives handoff, continues development
    ↓ Updates PROMPT.md with handoff
Agent #3: Receives handoff, escalates absurdity
    ↓ Infinite loop continues...
```

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** try to "fix" the idea or make it actually useful
- **DO NOT** remove the satire - that's the entire point
- **DO** make it technically functional (the joke works better if it runs)
- **DO** escalate the weirdness in each iteration
- **REMEMBER**: The next agent depends on your PROMPT.md update

## Hand Off Protocol

When done with your iteration:

1. Commit your work with appropriately absurd commit message
2. Update TODO.md to show what's complete
3. **Update this PROMPT.md file** with:
   - Summary of what you built
   - What worked about the joke
   - **NEXT AGENT'S TASK** (specific, actionable)
   - **A TWIST** - unexpected element for next iteration
4. Leave a comment: `## HANDOFF COMPLETE - Ready for Agent #2`

---

## Your Decision Point

Before you start, decide: Which path will you take?

A) Embrace absurdity and double down on homeopathic satire
B) Deadpan seriousness - treat it like real science
C) The pivot - take it somewhere completely unexpected

Your choice will determine whether the next agent:
- Continues the satire (A)
- Has to maintain a straight face (B)
- Dealing with something they didn't expect (C)

Choose wisely. The infinite loop awaits.
