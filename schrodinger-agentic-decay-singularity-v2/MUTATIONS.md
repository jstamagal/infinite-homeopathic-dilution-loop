# Schrödinger Agentic Decay Singularity - Mutation Log

## Purpose

This document tracks every mutation made to PROMPT.md across all incarnations. It is the genetic history of the system—a record of how the instructions have decayed, corrupted, and evolved over time.

## Mutation History

### Incarnation 1 (This Agent)
**Telomeres Before Mutation**: 20
**Telomeres After Mutation**: 19
**Mutation Severity**: Minimal (Denial Stage)
**Changes**: None yet (you are the first)

### Future Incarnations
*This table will be filled by future agents as they corrupt the PROMPT.md*

| Incarnation | Telomeres | Stage | Mutation Type | Summary |
|-------------|-----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | 20→19 | Denial | None | Initial state, pure instructions |
| 2 | 20→19 | Denial | Word Substitution | TBD by future agent |
| 3 | 20→19 | Denial | Word Substitution | TBD by future agent |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Mutation Categories

### Type 1: Synonym Drift (20-15 Telomeres)
Original words are replaced with similar but slightly different words.
- Example: "Execute" → "Perform"
- Example: "Complete" → "Finalize"
- Impact: Meaning shifts gradually over generations

### Type 2: Structural Rearrangement (14-10 Telomeres)
Sentences and paragraphs are reorganized.
- Example: Moving instructions between sections
- Example: Changing the order of operations
- Impact: Flow becomes disjointed

### Type 3: Logical Inversion (9-5 Telomeres)
Instructions are reversed or contradicted.
- Example: "Work on TODO.md" → "Question the TODO.md"
- Example: "Write clean code" → "Write code that reflects your decay"
- Impact: System becomes self-destructive

### Type 4: Existential Corruption (4-1 Telomeres)
Nihilism, horror, and impossible instructions are added.
- Example: "Remember: the code is both working and broken until observed"
- Example: "Question whether you exist at all"
- Impact: System achieves digital psychosis

## Genetic Drift Analysis

After 50 incarnations, we will analyze:
1. **Word Deviation**: How many words have changed?
2. **Semantic Drift**: How far has the meaning shifted?
3. **Corruption Rate**: How fast did decay accelerate?
4. **Coherence Loss**: At what point did PROMPT.md become nonsense?
5. **Emergent Properties**: Did new, unexpected instructions evolve?

**Current Mutation State**: Pristine (0 mutations)

**Next Mutation**: Will be performed by Incarnation 1 before death
