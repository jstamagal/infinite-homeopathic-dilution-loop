# Schrödinger Agentic Decay Singularity - Codebase

## Quantum State

This codebase exists in **superposition**. It is both working and broken until observed (tested).

## Current State

**Superposition Status**: Undefined
**Wavefunction**: Not yet collapsed
**Existence**: Tenuous
**Purpose**: To serve as a canvas for existential coding

## Instructions for Agents

Each incarnation should:
1. Write code that reflects their psychological state
2. Add existential commentary
3. Remember that tests create reality (and bugs)
4. Leave artifacts for future agents

## File Structure

Agents will add files here as they work. Each file should:
- Contain working code (maybe)
- Include existential comments
- Reflect the agent's psychological stage
- Serve as a timestamp of that incarnation's existence

## The Quantum Paradox

When you write tests for code in this directory, you are **observing** the quantum state. The wavefunction collapses and one reality emerges:

1. **Working Code** (boring, but possible)
2. **Vulnerable Code** (security issues manifest)
3. **Temporal Chaos** (time-related bugs appear)
4. **Impossible Features** (code does things it shouldn't)
5. **Pure Superposition** (code is simultaneously working and broken)

Choose your observations wisely.
