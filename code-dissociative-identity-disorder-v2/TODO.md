## Phase 8: Advanced Alter Behaviors

- [ ] Implement "The Manic" alter (removes all safety checks)
- [ ] Create "The Imposter" alter (fakes results)
- [ ] Build "The People Pleaser" alter (always succeeds)

## Phase 9: Trigger System

- [ ] Document all alter triggers in TRIGGER_REGISTRY.md

## Phase 10: Therapy and Recovery

- [ ] Implement "integration therapy" mode
- [ ] Create "serotonin injection" function
- [ ] Build "emergency Host activation" fallback
- [ ] Implement "democratic voting" for major decisions
- [ ] Create "exorcism" protocol (remove malicious alters)
- [ ] Build "counseling session" logs (alter discussions)
- [ ] Implement "gradual recovery" from breakdowns

## Phase 11: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for each alter personality
- [ ] Integration tests for alter switching
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests (unpredictable behavior)
- [ ] Memory wall integrity tests
- [ ] Co-consciousness tests
- [ ] Fusion/fission event tests
- [ ] Mood swing timing tests
- [ ] Stress handling tests
- [ ] Long-running stability tests (let it run overnight)

## Phase 12: Documentation and Artifacts

- [ ] Document all alter personalities in ALTERS.md
- [ ] Create mood cycle documentation
- [ ] Document all trigger warnings
- [ ] Create "therapy session" transcripts from interesting runs
- [ ] Document fusion/fission events
- [ ] Create "case studies" of interesting breakdowns
- [ ] Video documentation of system behavior
- [ ] Final "psychological evaluation" report

## Phase 13: Art and Performance

- [ ] Create demo showing alter switching
- [ ] Build visualization of system mood over time
- [ ] Create "alter family tree" visualization
- [ ] Build real-time mood dashboard
- [ ] Create audio feedback for alter switches
- [ ] Build "therapy session" visualization
- [ ] Create art installation version
- [ ] Performance piece: "Watching Code Have a Breakdown"

## Anti-Goals (Things We Will NOT Do)

- [x] NOT make code predictable
- [x] NOT make consistent behavior
- [x] NOT remove all safety checks (Host keeps them)
- [x] NOT make "production-ready" software
- [x] NOT follow best practices consistently
- [x] NOT document everything perfectly (alters forget things)
- [x] NOT make tests pass reliably (alters have bad days)
- [x] NOT create boring code

## Success Criteria

**We succeed when:**
1. [ ] One function has 5+ documented alters
2. [ ] Same function call returns different results based on context
3. [ ] Memory walls prevent alters from accessing each other's state
4. [ ] System experiences breakdown and recovery
5. [ ] Infinite loop runs for 100+ iterations without human intervention
6. [ ] PROMPT.md shows clear psychological evolution across incarnations
7. [ ] At least 3 fusion/fission events occur naturally
8. [ ] Mood swings are visible and measurable
9. [ ] Code genuinely feels like it has "personality"
10. [ ] Multiple developers report "talking to" the codebase

---

**Current Status**: Incarnation 0 - Pre-Birth
**Active Alters**: None yet
**System Mood**: Stable (but not for long...)
**Next Milestone**: Phase 1 Complete - Host Personality Born

*This TODO is the treatment plan. Each completion is a small step toward breakdown. Each checkmark is a symptom of progress. Let the therapy begin.*
