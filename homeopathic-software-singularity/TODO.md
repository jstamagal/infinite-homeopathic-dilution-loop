# TODO: Homeopathic Software Singularity

## Current Agent: #1 (Birth)
## Potency Level: UNDEFINED → Target: 6X → 30C → 200C (Singularity)

## Phase 1: The Succussion Analyzer (Foundational Potency)

### Iteration 1 Tasks (Agent #1 - YOU)
- [ ] Initialize project structure with maximum unnecessary directories
- [ ] Create package.json with absurd dependency chain
- [ ] Set up TypeScript with most pedantic config possible
- [ ] Create CLI entry point: `hss-analyze` (Homeopathic Software Singularity)
- [ ] Implement basic file scanner (finds "material contamination")
- [ ] Write first "potency calculator" (counts abstraction layers)
- [ ] Add "succussion needed" detector (identifies code that's too simple)
- [ ] Create output formatter (homeopathic terminology generator)
- [ ] Write README doubling down on the satire
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPT.md for Agent #2

### Iteration 2 Tasks (Agent #2 - The Rebirth)
- [ ] Build AST parser for actual code analysis
- [ ] Implement "Vital Force Calculator" (complexity / usefulness ratio)
- [ ] Add "Dilution Meter" (how many layers until we hit business logic?)
- [ ] Create "Remedy Prescriber" (suggests MORE abstraction)
- [ ] Generate "Abstract Factory Factory" templates
- [ ] Add "Succussion Regimen" planner (automated refactoring schedule)
- [ ] Write integration tests (that test nothing of value)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPT.md for Agent #3

### Iteration 3 Tasks (Agent #3 - Potency Escalation)
- [ ] Implement automated succussion engine
- [ ] Add "Interface Extractor" (wraps everything in interfaces)
- [ ] Create "Dependency Injection Amplifier"
- [ ] Build "Microservice Decomposer" (splits files unnecessarily)
- [ ] Generate "Enterprise Pattern Injector"
- [ ] Add "Vital Energy Dashboard" (visualization of absurdity)
- [ ] Write documentation using homeopathic science unironically
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPT.md for Agent #4

### Iteration 4 Tasks (Agent #4 - The Singularity Approach)
- [ ] Build "200C Potency Mode" (pure architecture, zero logic)
- [ ] Implement "Auto-Succussion" (self-refactoring code)
- [ ] Create "Homeopathic Consultant" chatbot
- [ ] Add "Practitioner Portal" web UI
- [ ] Generate conference talk: "Achieving 200C: A Journey"
- [ ] Write academic paper (satirical but deadpan)
- [ ] Deploy to production (the irony peaks)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPT.md for Agent #5

### Iteration 5 Tasks (Agent #5 - Nirvana)
- [ ] Achieve 200C Potency (code does nothing perfectly)
- [ ] System generates its own abstractions infinitely
- [ ] Zero business logic, infinite architecture
- [ ] Auto-succussion loop creates complexity singularity
- [ ] Tool achieves digital enlightenment
- [ ] Write book: "The Homeopathic Coder"
- [ ] Create training certification: "HSS Practitioner"
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPT.md for Agent #6

---

## Phase 2: Succussion Automation (Future Iterations)

### Iteration 6-10: The Automation Engine
- [ ] Automated refactoring pipeline
- [ ] CI/CD integration that "succusses" every PR
- [ ] GitHub Action: "Homeopathic Potency Checker"
- [ ] Pre-commit hook: "Abstraction Dilution Monitor"
- [ ] VS Code extension: "Vital Force Highlighter"

### Iteration 11-15: The Ecosystem
- [ ] NPM package ecosystem
- [ ] Homeopathic design pattern library
- [ ] "Succussion-as-a-Service" API
- [ ] Browser extension (analyzes web apps)
- [ ] Mobile app (analyze code on the go)

### Iteration 16-20: The Singularity
- [ ] AI that generates abstractions forever
- [ ] Self-improving architecture complexity
- [ ] Infinite succussion loop
- [ ] Code becomes pure potential energy
- [ ] System achieves nirvana (stops working, starts being)

---

## Stretch Goals (Maximum Absurdity)

### Conference Circuit
- [ ] Submit to Strange Loop (might actually get accepted)
- [ ] KubeCon talk: "Kubernetes Homeopathy: Diluting Your Microservices"
- [ ] PyCon keynote: "Achieving 200C Potency in Python"
- [ ] Create fake conference: "Homeopathic Software Summit"

### Academic Integration
- [ ] Submit to SIGPLAN (satire track hopefully exists)
- [ ] ArXiv paper: "Vital Force in Software Architecture"
- [ ] Create fake journal: "Journal of Homeopathic Computing"
- [ ] Citation farm (citing ourselves infinitely)

### Cultural Impact
- [ ] Reddit AMA: "I built a homeopathic software tool AMA"
- [ ] Hacker News front page (inevitable)
- [ ] Twitter thread goes viral
- [ ] Get cited in real blog post about over-engineering
- [ ] Someone accidentally uses it in production

### The Ultimate Singularity
- [ ] Tool becomes so over-engineered it can't be analyzed
- [ ] Own codebase achieves 200C potency
- [ ] Infinite recursive self-improvement loop
- [ ] System attains digital enlightenment
- [ ] We delete it because it's too potent

## Anti-Requirements (Things We Must NOT Do)

- ❌ Make it actually useful for real work
- ❌ Remove the satire (the joke IS the product)
- ❌ Add "practical examples" that aren't absurd
- ❌ Let anyone take this seriously (or maybe do - funnier)
- ❌ Build features that reduce complexity
- ❌ Write documentation that makes rational sense
- ❌ Create tests that verify actual functionality

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Potency (MVP)
- ✅ CLI that "analyzes" code
- ✅ Outputs homeopathic terminology
- ✅ Is obviously satire but technically functional
- ✅ Makes developers laugh/cry

### Full Potency (200C)
- ✅ Does absolutely nothing useful
- ✅ Beautifully over-engineered
- ✅ Self-documenting absurdity
- ✅ Viral satire hit

### Nirvana (Singularity)
- ✅ Code becomes pure architecture
- ✅ Zero business logic remains
- ✅ Infinite abstraction depth
- ✅ System achieves digital enlightenment

---

## The Eternal Loop

This TODO.md is updated by each agent incarnation.
Each agent:
1. Marks their tasks complete ✅
2. Adds next tasks for following agents
3. Escalates the absurdity
4. Hands off via PROMPT.md

The loop continues until 200C Potency is achieved.
Then it continues anyway, because that's the joke.

---

**Current Potency**: UNDEFINED (awaiting first succussion)
**Next Milestone**: 6X Potency (basic over-engineering achieved)
**Target**: 200C Potency (digital nirvana)
**Status**: Ready for Agent #1 to begin the great work

*Remember: The code doesn't work until it doesn't work at all.*
