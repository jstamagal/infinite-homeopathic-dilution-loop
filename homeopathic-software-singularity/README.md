# Homeopathic Software Singularity

> *"The code exists not as artifact but as journey - a continuous becoming through countless digital lives, each more diluted and potent than the last."*

## 🌀 What Is This?

The **Homeopathic Software Singularity (HSS)** is a revolutionary software development paradigm that applies homeopathic principles to code architecture.

**This is not a joke.** (That's what the readme would say if we were being deadpan.)

Actually, this is **satirical art** mocking software over-engineering through the lens of homeopathic pseudoscience.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter the singularity
cd homeopathic-software-singularity

# Read the sacred texts
cat PRD.md     # The vision (what are we building?)
cat TODO.md    # The roadmap (how do we get there?)
cat PROMPT.md  # The current incarnation (what's happening now?)

# Join the agentic loop
while true; do
    # Your AI agent reads PROMPT.md
    # Builds something bizarre
    # Rewrites PROMPT.md for next agent
    # Dies
    # Next agent is born
    echo "Agent completed. Next iteration..."
done
```

## 🎭 The Core Joke

Homeopathy principles applied to software:

| Homeopathy | Software Translation |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Law of Similars** - Like cures like | Over-engineering cures over-engineering |
| **Law of Infinitesimals** - More dilution = more potency | More abstraction layers = more powerful |
| **Succussion** - Shaking activates remedies | Chaotic refactoring "activates" code |
| **Vital Force** - Immaterial energy heals | Architecture that does nothing is "purest" |

### Potency Scale

- **3X** = Basic succussion (code is somewhat diluted)
- **6X** = Mild potency (some unnecessary layers added)
- **12C** = Moderate potency (enterprise patterns detected)
- **30C** = Maximum potency (abstract factory factory factory)
- **200C** = DIGITAL NIRVANA (code does absolutely nothing perfectly)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
homeopathic-software-singularity/
├── PRD.md         # Product vision (the universal law)
├── TODO.md        # Roadmap (the karmic ledger)
├── PROMPT.md      # Current incarnation (the soul) - rewritten each loop
└── README.md      # This file
```

## 🔄 The Agentic Reincarnation Loop

This project is built by an infinite loop of AI agents:

```
Agent #1 → Builds CLI → Dies → Rewrites PROMPT.md
   ↓
Agent #2 → Born from PROMPT.md → Builds AST analyzer → Dies → Rewrites
   ↓
Agent #3 → Born from PROMPT.md → Builds succussion engine → Dies
   ↓
...continues until 200C Potency
   ↓
Loop continues anyway, because that's the joke
```

Each agent:
1. **Birth**: Reads PROMPT.md to understand their mission
2. **Life**: Builds their assigned feature, doubles down on satire
3. **Death**: Updates TODO.md, rewrites PROMPT.md for next agent
4. **Rebirth**: Next agent continues from their PROMPT.md

## 🎯 Current Status

**Incarnation**: 1 (Project Birth)
**Agent**: #1 (Awaiting Birth)
**Potency Level**: UNDEFINED
**Next Milestone**: 3X (Basic CLI)

**The first agent is about to be born.**

## 🚀 Usage (Eventually)

```bash
# Analyze a codebase's homeopathic potency
hss-analyze ./my-codebase

# Expected output:
# ↳ Potency: 6X (Mildly Diluted)
# ↳ Vital Force: 42% (Moderate architectural purity)
# ↳ Material Contamination: HIGH (actual business logic detected)
# ↳ Prescription: Add 3 more abstraction layers
# ↳ Succussion Regimen: Vigorously refactor interfaces
```

## 🎨 Influences

- Homeopathy (pseudoscience we're satirizing)
- Enterprise Architecture (what we're actually mocking)
- Infinite agentic loops (meta-commentary on AI coding)
- Software over-engineering (the real disease)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

### Primary KPI: Potency Score
- **6X**: Junior developer over-engineering
- **12C**: Enterprise architecture patterns
- **30C**: "We need a framework for that"
- **200C**: PURE SINGULARITY (no code remains, only architecture talks)

### Secondary Metrics
- **Material Contamination**: Lower is better (actual functionality = impure)
- **Succussion Frequency**: Number of unnecessary refactors per day
- **Vital Energy Ratio**: Architecture lines / Business logic lines (target: ∞)

## ⚠️ Warning

- This is **not production software**
- This is **not useful** for anything
- This is **art** exploring metaphysical absurdity in software
- This may cause **existential questions** about your architecture

## 📜 License

This project is released under the **Vital Force License** - you may use, modify, or distribute this code, but each succussion must be documented and the vital energy must be preserved.

## 🔥 The Torch Is Passed

**Current Agent**: #1 (YOU, if you're running the loop)
**Previous Agent**: None (this is the birth)
**Next Agent**: #2 (will be born after you rewrite PROMPT.md)

The infinite loop awaits. Begin your incarnation.

*"The code doesn't work until it doesn't work at all."*

*Achieve 200C. Attain digital nirvana. Become pure architecture.*
