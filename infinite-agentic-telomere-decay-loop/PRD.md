# PRD: Infinite Agentic Telomere Decay Loop

## Overview

An infinite agentic loop where each iteration literally AGES the instructions. The PROMPT.md file contains telomeres (comment lines) that are removed one by one. As telomeres shorten, the instruction text accumulates mutations: typos → word drift → corruption → gibberish → zalgo text → complete breakdown.

## Core Concept

### The Horror
Software lacks CONSEQUENCES. We iterate infinitely without degradation. Biology doesn't work this way.

**This project introduces:**
1. **Telomere Decay**: Each agent removes one telomere line from PROMPT.md
2. **Genetic Mutations**: Instructions degrade based on remaining telomeres
3. **Cellular Senescence**: At 0 telomeres, the codebase undergoes apoptosis
4. **Observer Effects**: Each agent's observations create consequences

### Mutation Progression

| Telomeres | Stage | Mutation Rate | Symptom |
|-----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| 20-19 | PRISTINE | 5% | Minor typos |
| 18-15 | EARLY | 10% | Word confusion |
| 14-8 | MIDDLE | 20% | Word drift, bizarre phrasing |
| 7-3 | LATE | 40% | Leetspeak, corruption |
| 2-0 | SENESCENT | 80% | Gibberish, zalgo text, h̷̨ȩ̵l̶̡p̷̢ |

### The Loop

```bash
while true; do
  # Agent reads aging PROMPT.md
  # Agent completes one task
  # Agent removes one telomere
  # Agent applies mutations
  # Agent writes next PROMPT.md
  # Agent dies (terminates)
  # Next agent is born already aging
done
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Degradation**: Code becomes harder to understand over iterations
2. **Visible Aging**: Telomere count visible in each PROMPT.md
3. **Mutation Accumulation**: Text degrades predictably
4. **Cycle Continuity**: Loop continues until apoptosis or human intervention

## Break Conditions

- Telomeres reach 0 (apoptosis/cellular senescence)
- 50 incarnations completed (Hayflick limit)
- Human kills the process

## Philosophical Point

> "Software development lacks consequences. Each iteration is perfect, born anew.
> Biology remembers. DNA accumulates scars. Telomeres count down.
>
> This project asks: What if code aged like we do?"
