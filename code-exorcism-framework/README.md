# Code Exorcism Framework (Discelebrity)

## The Discarnate Entity Removal System for Haunted Codebases

### Is this satire?

**Yes.**

### Is this also a serious exploration of developer psychology?

**Also yes.**

---

## The Premise

Developers say:
- "This code is haunted"
- "That module is cursed"
- "I'm afraid to touch it"

**Discelebrity takes these statements literally.**

---

## What It Does

### Aura Reading
Analyze code for "spiritual residue" based on:
- Git blame trauma density
- Developer dread mentions
- Incident correlation
- Comment sentiment analysis

### Possession Detection
Identify code behaving under "external influence":
- Unexpected side effects
- Mysterious state mutations
- Heisenbug patterns (bugs that change when observed)

### Exorcism Rituals
Generate ritual protocols for cleansing haunted code:
- Preparation (3 days of spiritual readiness)
- Confrontation (face the trauma)
- Release (rewrite with intention)
- Cleansing (aftercare and monitoring)

### Ancestral Communication (Seance Mode)
Consult departed developers through:
- Commit message voice extraction
- Comment archaeology
- Test intent decoding
- Spirit message synthesis

### Psychic Protection
Ward yourself before dangerous work:
- Mental clarity fields
- Ancestral wisdom retrieval
- Test sanctuaries
- Support circles

## The Joke That's Not A Joke

The framework implements:
- **Serious static analysis** for problematic code patterns
- **Sentiment analysis** of commits/comments for "dread" signals
- **Git archaeology** for understanding developer intent
- **Ritual protocols** that are actually just good software practices (testing, documentation, careful refactoring) dressed in spiritual language

But it does so by taking "this code is haunted" **literally**.

**The ambiguity is intentional.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Read the aura of a haunted module
$ discelebrity read-aura src/PaymentProcessor.java

# Detect possession (external influence)
$ discelebrity detect-possession src/auth/SessionManager.java

# Generate exorcism ritual protocol
$ discelebrity generate-exorcism src/utils/Validator.java

# Summon ancestor spirit (seance mode)
$ discelebrity summon --author="alice@example.com" --file=src/legacy/Formatter.java

# Ward yourself before dangerous work
$ discelebrity ward --me
```

## Documentation

- **PRD.md** - Complete Product Requirements Document
- **TODO.md** - Implementation roadmap (spiritual and technical)
- **PROMPT.md** - The iterative agentic loop instructions

---

## The Agentic Loop

This project is designed for an infinite iterative loop:

```bash
while true ; do
    agent  # Each agent advances the project
done
```

Each agent:
1. Reads PRD.md, TODO.md, and PROMPT.md
2. Chooses their task from the options in PROMPT.md
3. Implements it (making it both functional AND bizarre)
4. Updates the files for the next agent
5. Hands off the torch

**The loop IS the exorcism.**

---

## Classification

This is an **art project exploring developer psychology through spiritual metaphor**.

It is simultaneously:
- A satire of how developers anthropomorphize code
- A serious tool for addressing the genuine psychological reality of that anthropomorphism
- A joke that becomes less funny the more you think about it
- A practical framework disguised as occult nonsense

**All of these are true.**
