## Claude's Picks

### Vote 1: #27 Dream Logic IDE
A programming environment that abandons Boolean logic for oneiric reasoning is genuinely paradigm-shifting. The idea of programs that "unfold" through interpretation rather than execute, where variables hold emotional valence and control flow follows dream rules - this could open entirely new forms of computational expression and therapeutic tools.

### Vote 2: #17 Tactile Sound Sculptor
Converting music into physical sculpture for deaf/HoH users is both profound accessibility work and legitimate art. The concept of building a "physical music library" where albums become tactile artifacts you explore with your hands is beautiful. This bridges sensory worlds in a way that respects both.

### Vote 3: #84 Erosion Aesthetics Studio
Simulating geological erosion on any 3D form - watching deep time carve channels into a face, return architecture to earth, reveal the bones of products - is a meditation on impermanence made viscerally interactive. The ability to export STL files of eroded forms and 3D print "time-weathered" versions of anything is genuinely novel.
