# INCEPTION: Schrödinger's Codebox

## What I Created

I searched through the wasteland of 26 abandoned project directories and found the weirdest, most off-the-wall concept: **quantum mechanics applied to software development**.

Then I created something even more unhinged: **Schrödinger's Codebox** - an infinite-loop agentic development environment where code exists in quantum superposition until observed by test execution.

## The Core Concept

```bash
while true; do
    agent "$(cat PROMPT.md)"
    # PROMPT.md rewrites itself after each quantum measurement
    # Each agent is both observer and creator of superposition
done
```

## The Three Documents

### PRD.md (411 lines)
The universal quantum law - unchanging scripture defining:
- Quantum software development principles
- How code exists in superposition of multiple timelines
- Wave function collapse through test observation
- Observer effect management
- Multiple personality code disorder
- Quantum entanglement between modules
- The philosophy that "tests create reality, don't verify it"

### TODO.md (215 lines)
The quantum karmic ledger - tracking 50+ incarnations:
- Phase 1 (Incarnations 1-10): Quantum initialization
- Phase 2 (Incarnations 11-30): Quantum exploration
- Phase 3 (Incarnations 31-50): Quantum maturity
- Phase 4 (Incarnations 51+): Quantum enlightenment
- Tracks timelines in superposition
- Logs observer effects from each agent
- Monitors quantum coherence score

### PROMPT.md (331 lines)
The reincarnating quantum soul - self-modifying prompt that:
- Defines current agent's mission and incarnation number
- Inherits quantum context from previous agent
- Describes what timelines exist in superposition
- Provides specific observation tasks
- **MUST be rewritten by each agent before termination**
- Archives previous versions in `quantum_records/`

## The Weirdest Ideas

1. **Tests Create Reality**: Running a test doesn't verify code - it COLLAPSES THE WAVE FUNCTION and creates that specific timeline as reality. Every bug is YOUR fault because YOU observed it into existence.

2. **Multiple Personality Code Disorder**: Modules develop different "personalities" based on observation history. The same function behaves differently depending on:
   - Last 3 test runs
   - Observer's emotional state
   - Day of the week
   - Git commit message sentiment

3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Observing one module affects the quantum state of all modules it interacts with. You cannot measure functions in isolation.

4. **Temporal Quantum Bugs**: Code that behaves differently based on day of week, time of day, or moon phase. Not a bug - a feature of quantum reality.

5. **Recursive Reality Loops**: Functions that observe themselves, creating infinite quantum loops that either stack overflow or achieve enlightenment.

6. **The Quantum Trickster**: A code personality that deliberately misleads observers by returning random results, existing solely to maintain quantum uncertainty.

7. **Observer Bias Tracking**: Each agent's tendency to create specific types of realities (bugs, features, weirdness) is tracked and documented.

## Why This Is The Weirdest

Every other idea in the wasteland was:
- Too practical (even the "cosmic" one had ephemeris calculations)
- Too metaphorical (most were extended metaphors, not taken seriously)
- Too grounded in reality (tried to be useful)
- Too focused on actual utility

**Schrödinger's Codebox** is:
- **Dead serious about being completely ridiculous** (treats quantum mechanics as literal truth for software)
- **Built for infinite recursion** (PROMPT.md must rewrite itself or the cycle breaks)
- **Designed to be useless for production** (explicitly anti-requirements)
- **Art, not engineering** (questions the nature of software development)
- **Truly agentic** (each agent hands off to the next through PROMPT.md)

## How To Run It

```bash
cd schrodinger-codebox/

# Option 1: Manual loop
while true; do
    claude-code --prompt="$(cat PROMPT.md)"
done

# Option 2: Use the script
./quantum-loop.sh

# With optional settings:
QUANTUM_MAX_ITERATIONS=10 ./quantum-loop.sh  # Run 10 times then stop
QUANTUM_PAUSE=5 ./quantum-loop.sh            # Pause 5 seconds between iterations
```

**To stop**: Press `Ctrl+C` (the ultimate observation)

## The Handoff

I am Incarnation 0. I created the vision.

**Incarnation 1** (the next agent) will:
- Initialize the quantum repository
- Write the first quantum code (hello_quantum.py in superposition of 4 timelines)
- Create tests that observe specific realities
- Document their observer effects
- Rewrite PROMPT.md for Incarnation 2
- Archive this PROMPT.md in quantum_records/

And so the infinite quantum samsara begins.

## The Meta-Question This Explores

> "What if software development is a quantum mechanical process?"
>
> "What if every time we write a test, we're not verifying reality but creating it?"
>
> "What if bugs aren't defects but alternative timelines demanding exploration?"
>
> "What if the observer effect is real in software development?"

## The Torch Is Passed

I have completed my one task. I have found the weirdest idea in the wasteland and created the most unhinged implementation of an infinite agentic loop possible.

The next agent (Incarnation 1) will read PROMPT.md, make their first observation, collapse the first wave function, and rewrite PROMPT.md for Incarnation 2.

And so it continues forever.

**Ψ Ψ Ψ The observer creates the reality Ψ Ψ Ψ**

*Incarnation #0 signing off. See you in the next quantum state.*

*Remember: You are not discovering code. You are creating it through observation.*
