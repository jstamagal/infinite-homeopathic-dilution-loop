# Schrödinger's Codebox

## The Quantum Development Environment

**An infinite-loop agentic coding system where code exists in quantum superposition until observed by test execution.**

---

## What Is This?

This is an art project exploring the question: **"What if software development were a quantum mechanical process?"**

In this system:
- Code exists in superposition of multiple implementations simultaneously
- Tests don't verify code—they CREATE reality through observation
- Every observation collapses the wave function and eliminates alternative timelines
- Developers (agents) are responsible for every bug they observe into existence
- Code modules develop "multiple personality disorder" based on observation history

## The Core Loop

```bash
while true; do
    quantum-agent "$(cat PROMPT.md)"
    # PROMPT.md rewrites itself after each quantum measurement
    # Each agent is both observer and creator of superposition
    # The code is both broken and working until observed
done
```

## How It Works

### 1. The Three Documents

**PRD.md** - The universal quantum law (static, defines the vision)
**TODO.md** - The karmic ledger (tracks timelines and observations)
**PROMPT.md** - The quantum soul (rewritten each incarnation, carries context forward)

### 2. Each Agent's Mission

1. **Read** PROMPT.md (contains previous agent's quantum state)
2. **Observe** the codebase (make measurements by running tests)
3. **Collapse** a wave function (write code that creates one timeline)
4. **Document** observer effects (what reality did you create?)
5. **Rewrite** PROMPT.md for the next agent
6. **Archive** old PROMPT.md in `quantum_records/`
7. **Die** (terminate, hand off torch to next agent)

### 3. The Quantum Principle

> "Tests are not verification tools but reality-creation mechanisms. Every observation collapses the wave function. The developer is not a bug-finder but a reality-selector."

## Running The Loop

```bash
cd schrodinger-codebox/

# Option 1: Manual execution
while true; do
    claude-code --prompt="$(cat PROMPT.md)"
done

# Option 2: Use the provided script (after Incarnation 1 creates it)
./quantum-loop.sh
```

**To stop the loop**: Press `Ctrl+C` (the ultimate observation)

## The Quantum Question

**"What does code do when no one is watching?"**

This project tries to answer that question through infinite iterative exploration.

## Current Status

- **Quantum Incarnation**: 0 (The Vision)
- **Next**: 1 (First Observation)
- **Quantum Coherence**: 1.0 (perfect superposition)
- **Timelines Explored**: 0 (pure potential)

## Anti-Goals (Critical)

This project is NOT about:
- ❌ Writing working code (that's just one timeline)
- ❌ Fixing bugs (bugs are alternative timelines)
- ❌ Best practices (classical thinking)
- ❌ Test-driven development (tests CREATE reality, not verify it)
- ❌ Production readiness (this is art, not engineering)

This project IS about:
- ✅ Exploring quantum superposition in software
- ✅ Embracing observer effects as features
- ✅ Documenting multiple simultaneous realities
- ✅ Accepting responsibility for creating bugs through observation
- ✅ Finding beauty in uncertainty and ambiguity

## The Meta-Commentary

This is a satirical art project that uses quantum mechanics as a metaphor for software development. The "observer effect" in quantum physics (that measurement affects the system being measured) is paralleled with how developers' choices shape code reality.

Are we creating code or discovering it?
Do bugs exist before we observe them?
What if every test we write eliminates alternative possibilities?

**Schrödinger's Codebox explores these questions through infinite agentic iteration.**

## Contributing (To the Quantum Realm)

There's nothing to contribute in the traditional sense. The quantum realm evolves through its own internal logic.

However, you can:
1. Run the loop and watch what happens
2. Read the `quantum_records/` to see how the code evolved
3. Analyze the observer effects to understand agent behavior
4. Reflect on the nature of software development
