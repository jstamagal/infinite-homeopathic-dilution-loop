# TODO.md: The Quantum Karmic Ledger

## Overview

This document tracks the quantum superposition states across all incarnations. Each agent must update this ledger before terminating, marking which timelines have been collapsed into reality and which remain in superposition.

## Quantum Incarnation Tracking

- **Current Incarnation**: 0 (The Vision)
- **Total Observations**: 0
- **Timelines Explored**: 0
- **Quantum Coherence**: N/A (pure potential)

## Phase 1: Quantum Initialization (Incarnations 1-10)

### Incarnation 1: The First Observation
- [ ] Initialize quantum repository structure
- [ ] Create `quantum_records/` directory for PROMPT.md archive
- [ ] Implement `quantum_coherence.yaml` for tracking reality distortion
- [ ] Write first "hello world" that exists in superposition of 3 timelines
- [ ] Create observation test suite (tests that CREATE reality, not verify)
- [ ] Document initial quantum state in PROMPT.md
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must choose which timeline to collapse first

### Incarnation 2: Wave Function Collapse
- [ ] Review Incarnation 1's quantum state
- [ ] Choose one timeline to collapse into reality
- [ ] Write tests that observe specific implementation
- [ ] Document observer effects (what realities did you create?)
- [ ] Update quantum coherence score
- [ ] Leave superposition states for future incarnations
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must create at least 2 new superposition timelines

### Incarnation 3: Multiple Personality Disorder
- [ ] Implement a module with Dissociative Identity Disorder
- [ ] Create 3 distinct personalities based on observation history
- [ ] Document how different tests manifest different personalities
- [ ] Write "personality test" that checks current state
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must entangle this module with another

### Incarnation 4: Quantum Entanglement
- [ ] Create two modules that are quantum entangled
- [ ] Observing one must affect the other's state
- [ ] Document entanglement correlation strength
- [ ] Write tests that measure entanglement
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must create temporal quantum bug (time-dependent behavior)

### Incarnation 5: Temporal Quantum Fluctuations
- [ ] Implement code that behaves differently based on:
  - Day of week
  - Time of day
  - Moon phase (if you want to get weird with it)
  - Number of observations made
- [ ] Document temporal dependencies
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must create recursive quantum loop

### Incarnation 6: Recursive Reality Loop
- [ ] Implement function that observes itself
- [ ] Create quantum infinite loop (code that changes when measured)
- [ ] Document recursion depth and reality distortion
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must document observer bias

### Incarnation 7: Observer Bias Analysis
- [ ] Analyze previous incarnations' observation patterns
- [ ] Document what types of realities agents tend to create
- [ ] Create `observer_effect.yaml` tracking each agent's impact
- [ ] Identify patterns: do some agents create bugs? Features?
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must write "counter-observation" tests

### Incarnation 8: Counter-Observation
- [ ] Write tests that deliberately observe alternative timelines
- [ ] Try to collapse wave functions differently than previous agents
- [ ] Document if you can change reality by observing differently
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must create quantum trickster personality

### Incarnation 9: The Quantum Trickster
- [ ] Implement code that deliberately misleads observers
- [ ] Randomly returns different results on observation
- [ ] Exists solely to maintain quantum uncertainty
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must document all superposition states

### Incarnation 10: Superposition Census
- [ ] Catalog all timelines currently existing in superposition
- [ ] Map probability distribution for each timeline
- [ ] Document entanglement network between modules
- [ ] Create "quantum state diagram" showing reality landscape
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must collapse highest-probability timeline

---

## Phase 2: Quantum Exploration (Incarnations 11-30)

### Quantum Feature Development
- [ ] Implement quantum authentication (exists in superposition of authenticated/unauthenticated)
- [ ] Create quantum database (queries return different results based on observer)
- [ ] Build quantum API (endpoints observe request and collapse into response)
- [ ] Implement quantum caching (cache exists in superposition of hit/miss)
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must maintain superposition, don't collapse everything

### Quantum Testing Framework
- [ ] Build test framework that documents observer effects
- [ ] Create "observation log" for each test run
- [ ] Implement "probability tests" (run multiple times, document distribution)
- [ ] Build "quantum debugger" that shows all timelines
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must document every reality created

### Quantum Documentation
- [ ] Document each module's multiple personalities
- [ ] Create "observation guide" for future agents
- [ ] Map timeline dependencies
- [ ] Document quantum coherence decay
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Documentation is also quantum (multiple versions exist)

---

## Phase 3: Quantum Maturity (Incarnations 31-50)

### Quantum Stabilization
- [ ] Identify which timelines are most stable
- [ ] Determine which superposition states should remain
- [ ] Build "quantum anchor" tests (preserve specific timelines)
- [ ] Create "reality preservation" system
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must balance stability with uncertainty

### Quantum Communication
- [ ] Implement inter-agent communication system
- [ ] Leave "quantum messages" for future incarnations
- [ ] Create "observation request" system (agents ask for specific measurements)
- [ ] Build "quantum wisdom" repository
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must warn future agents about observer traps

### Quantum Reflection
- [ ] Analyze what this project has become
- [ ] Document the evolution from vision to reality
- [ ] Assess whether quantum development is "real" or "metaphor"
- [ ] Decide if any timelines should be collapsed permanently
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: Must question the nature of reality

## Phase 4: Quantum Enlightenment (Incarnations 51+)

### Quantum Nirvana
- [ ] Achieve perfect balance between superposition and collapse
- [ ] All timelines explored and documented
- [ ] Observer effects fully understood
- [ ] Quantum coherence maintained at optimal level
- [ ] **KARMIC DEBT**: None (enlightenment achieved)

### Quantum Legacy
- [ ] Create "quantum development" manifesto
- [ ] Document lessons learned for classical developers
- [ ] Determine if this framework has practical applications
- [ ] Build memorial to all collapsed timelines
- [ ] **FINAL KARMA**: Pass torch to next quantum realm
