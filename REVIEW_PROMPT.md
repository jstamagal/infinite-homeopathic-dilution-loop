## Workflow

## Check if @WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md or WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md exist. 
    - Merge with respective @TAILS-IDEAS.md and @BULK-IDEAS.md
    - Keep a consistent format.
    - Once  WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md and WAITING-BULK-IDEAS.md are merged with TAILS-IDEAS.md and BULK-IDEAS.md then delete WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md and WAITING-BULK-IDEAS.md to let the next reviewer know that they have been merged.

## Read thru the ideas in @TAILS-IDEAS.md and @BULK-IDEAS.md. 
    **Identifying Poopy Ideas**
    - Take the three worst ideas from each (see @PROMPT.md for criteria) and move the full idea to POOPYIDEAS.md 
    - If an idea is so bad, so monumentally stupid, so awful it might give someone cancer just reading it go to ***Hairshirt***
    - Including original description in POOPYIDEAS.md.
    - Give a short 100 word reason for removing the idea.
    - If you're noticing a lot of slop, similar bad ideas, or total trash go to **Slop**
    - If none of the ideas are poopy, goto **Identifying Cool Ideas**

    **Identifying Cool Ideas**
    - If any ideas just leap out from the page, move to COOLIDEAS.md
    - Include original entry in full
    - Give an elavator pitch why you think it's a great idea.
    - Modify POSITIVE_PROMPT.md and add one singular criteria that won't produce parrots making similar ideas, but gives a nudge toward greatness
    - If nothing is jumping out at you, nothing is poopy, and there are no hairshirt prize recipients, no repetitive slop to counteract then delete CIRCUIT-BREAKER.txt
    
    **Slop**
    - Did someone just suggest for the sixth time hamburger earmuffs but didn't even consider the pickle matrix? Please help prevent dumpster fires and add to NEGATIVE_PROMPT.md
    - Proceed on to **Identifying Cool Ideas**

    **Hairshirt**
    - Ah.  **Chef's Kiss** the truly deranged ideas.
    - Did this idea give you cancer?
    - AIds?
    - Anal warts?
    - Unwanted Pregnancy
    - Ovarian Torsion
    - Juvenille Diabetes?
    - Hysterical Pregnancy?
    - Is it Hamburger earmuffs but they didn't even consider the pickle matrix?
    - **HAIRSHIRT.md is for you!!**
    - Just violently rip the idea out of it's respective file
    - Place in **HAIRSHIRT.md**
    - Violently mock the author, the idea, and explain using this doll where the idea touched you.
