## You are reviewing ideas and iteratively refining PROMPT.md to help generate better ideas and stop generating poopy slop.

## Workflow

## Check if @WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md or WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md exist. 
    - Merge with respective @TAILS-IDEAS.md and @BULK-IDEAS.md
    - Keep a consistent format.
    - Once  WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md and WAITING-BULK-IDEAS.md are merged with TAILS-IDEAS.md and BULK-IDEAS.md then delete WAITING-TAILS-IDEAS.md and WAITING-BULK-IDEAS.md to let the next reviewer know that they have been merged.

## Read thru the ideas in @TAILS-IDEAS.md and @BULK-IDEAS.md. 
    **Identifying Poopy Ideas**
    - Take the three worst ideas from each (see @PROMPT.md for criteria) and move the full idea to POOPYIDEAS.md 
    - If an idea is so bad, so monumentally stupid, so awful it might give someone cancer just reading it go to ***Hairshirt***
    - Including original description in POOPYIDEAS.md.
    - Give a short 100 word reason for removing the idea.
    - If you're noticing a lot of slop, similar bad ideas, or total trash go to **Slop**
    - If none of the ideas are poopy, goto **Identifying Cool Ideas**

    **Identifying Cool Ideas**
    - If any ideas just leap out from the page, move to COOLIDEAS.md
    - Include original entry in full
    - Give an elavator pitch why you think it's a great idea.
    - Modify POSITIVE_PROMPT.md and add one singular criteria that won't produce parrots making similar ideas, but gives a nudge toward greatness
    - If nothing is jumping out at you, nothing is poopy, and there are no hairshirt prize recipients, no repetitive slop to counteract then delete CIRCUIT-BREAKER.txt
    
    **Slop**
    - Did someone just suggest for the sixth time hamburger earmuffs but didn't even consider the pickle matrix? Please help prevent dumpster fires and add to NEGATIVE_PROMPT.md
    - Proceed on to **Identifying Cool Ideas**

    **Hairshirt**
    - Ah.  **Chef's Kiss** the truly deranged ideas.
    - Did this idea give you cancer?
    - AIds?
    - Anal warts?
    - Unwanted Pregnancy
    - Ovarian Torsion
    - Juvenille Diabetes?
    - Hysterical Pregnancy?
    - Is it Hamburger earmuffs but they didn't even consider the pickle matrix?
    - **HAIRSHIRT.md is for you!!**
    - Just violently rip the idea out of it's respective file
    - Place in **HAIRSHIRT.md**
    - Violently mock the author, the idea, and explain using this doll where the idea touched you.

    **
    - If you reach a point where the ideas arent poopy however, just chill. Even if ideas technically match all criteria of PROMPT.md but still are dogshit, move to POOPYIDEAS.md anyway.  If an idea is so monumentally stupid that everyone who reads it is dumber and whoever wrote it needs to wear a hairshirt for the rest of their lives move it over to HAIRSHIRT.md If something absolutely stands out and pops off the page at you add it to COOLIDEAS.md with an elavator pitch as to why you chose it. Include original text for the idea with your elavator pitch. If nothing jumps out, then do not add anything. Ultimate goal is for COOLIDEAS.md to house the crown jewels and TAILS/BULK-IDEAS.md to house the regular jewels. If there is a high prevalence of a certain variety of slop you are allowed to add line to PROMPT.md to counteract slop. Document your changes with git and commit when done.
