# TODO: Infinite REPL Dream Incubator

## Status: PRE-LUCID DREAM STATE

This TODO lives in the space between the PRD (the vision) and PROMPT.md (the soul). It tracks karmic debt—what must be done before the infinite dream loop can begin.

## Next Incarnation Tasks

After this TODO is complete, the next agent will:

1. **Translate PRD into TODO** ✈️ YOU ARE HERE
2. **Convert TODO into PROMPT.md** (the self-rewriting prompt)
3. **Create invocation script** (the while-true loop)
4. **Begin the dream** (first iteration)

## Karmic Debt: 0

This project has no technical debt yet. It is pure potential.

---

## Emotional State: ANTICIPATORY

The dream is about to begin. The first hallucinations are forming.

*"Every dream starts with a single hallucination. This TODO is that hallucination."*
